The film featured three of France's most noticeable on-screen characters Ã¢ÂÂ GÄÅ¡rard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, who won a BAFTA grant for his execution, and Yves Montand in one of his last jobs before his passing. 

The film was shot consecutive with "Manon des Sources", over a time of seven months. At the time the most costly French film at any point made, it was an extraordinary business and basic achievement, both locally and globally, and was assigned for eight CÄÅ¡sar grants, and ten BAFTAs. The achievement of the two movies advanced Provence as a vacationer goal. 

The story happens outside a little town in Provence, France, soon after the First World War. Ugolin Soubeyran (Auteuil) returns promptly toward the beginning of the day from his military administration and awakens his uncle CÄÅ¡sar (Montand), brought in the neighborhood tongue 'Le Papet' which means granddad. Ugolin remains just quickly to talk, as he is anxious to get to his very own place more distant up in the mountains. Here he devotes himself completely to an undertaking thatÃ¢ÂÂat firstÃ¢ÂÂhe keeps mystery from Papet. He in the long run uncovers that the task comprises of developing carnations. Papet is at first incredulous, however he is persuaded when the blooms get a decent cost at the neighborhood advertise. They choose the venture is deserving of extension, and together they go to see the neighboring rancher known as Pique-Bouffigue, to purchase his property. 

The land being referred to is evidently "dry", yet Papet is aware of a wellspring of water, a spring, that can take care of that issue. Arouse Bouffigue does not have any desire to sell, and a squabble breaks out when he affronts the Soubeyran family. In the battle, Pique-Bouffigue is thumped dead. Papet considers this to be a chance, so after the burial service, Papet and Ugolin uncover the rubble that is filling the spring, plug the gap, and spread it with bond and afterward earth. Obscure to them, they are seen obstructing the spring by a poacher. 

The property slips to the dead man's sister, Florette, a cherished companion of Papet, who wedded the metal forger in another town while Papet was recouping in a military emergency clinic in Algeria. He keeps in touch with a typical companion for news on Florette and finds that she passed around the same time his letter arrived. The property consequently slides to her child who is a duty gatherer and "sadly, by God's will...he's a hunchback". To dishearten Florette's child from taking up living arrangement, Ugolin breaks numerous tiles on the top of the house. 

Florette's child (Depardieu), Jean, touches base with his significant other AimÄÅ¡e and youthful girl Manon, and the Soubeyrans' expectations of a simple takeover are before long broken. Florette's child is called Jean Cadoret, yet Ugolin, in the nearby custom, calls him Jean de Florette. Jean clarifies that he has no goal of selling, yet plans to take up habitation and live off the land. He has an amazing plan for making the ranch gainful inside two years, including reproducing rabbits and encouraging them off cucurbit. Jean does not think about the blocked spring, just of an increasingly removed one, and is depending on precipitation to fill a reservoir with water for providing domesticated animals and inundating crops. The removed spring, where an old Italian couple lives, is away and furthermore part of the property. Jean trusts the necessities of the ranch can be met from here. Ugolin is disheartened, yet Papet guides him to become a close acquaintence with Jean and increase his certainty. They additionally keep mystery from him the reality thatÃ¢ÂÂwhile normal precipitation for the encompassing district is sustainableÃ¢ÂÂthe region where Florette's ranch lies once in a while gets any of this downpour. Then, the two work to turn the nearby network against the newcomer, who is portrayed just as a hunchbacked previous expense authority, since the perished Pique-Bouffigue had cousins in the town who think about the blocked spring and would inform Jean regarding it should they come to confide in him. 

Jean at first gains ground, and procures a little benefit from his rabbit ranch. Over the long haul, getting water demonstrates an issue, and hauling it right from the far off spring turns into a backbreaking background. Jean requests to obtain Ugolin's donkey, however is met just with unclear reasons. At that point, when the downpour comes, it falls on the encompassing region however not where it is required. Jean boisterously castigates God, whom he supposes has officially given him enough inconvenience by misshaping him. Afterward, the dusty breezes of the sirocco likewise arrive, bringing the ranch to close fiasco. Jean is resolute, and chooses to burrow a well. Now Ugolin sees it fitting to attempt and persuade Jean that his undertaking is sad, and that he may be in an ideal situation selling. Jean asks the amount he could hope to get for the ranch, and Ugolin gives a gauge of around 8,000 francs. Jean has no goal of leaving however, yet needs to utilize the estimation of the property to take up a home loan of a large portion of that aggregate. Ugolin is upset, however Papet again observes opportunity: he will himself allow the home loan; that way he will either win the intrigue, or push Jean away for good. From the cash Jean purchases explosive to complete the well, however in his first impact is hit by a flying rock and falls into the pit. At first the wounds appear to be minor, yet it turns out his spine is cracked and when the specialist arrives he announces Jean dead. Ugolin comes back with the news to Papet, who asks him for what good reason he's crying. "It isn't me who's crying," he reacts, "it's my eyes". 

AimÄÅ¡e and Manon can't stay on the homestead, and Papet offers to get them out. As mother and little girl are pressing their effects, Papet and Ugolin advance toward where they hindered the spring, to haul out the fitting. Manon tails them, and when she sees what the two are doing, comprehends and gives out a yell. The men hear it, yet rapidly reject the sound as that of a vulture making an execute. As Papet plays out a false submersion of his nephew in the harsh elements water of the spring, the film closes with the inscription "end of section one". 

Marcel Pagnol's 1953 film "Manon des Sources" was four hours in length, and thusly cut by its wholesaler. The final product left Pagnol disappointed, and drove him to retell the story as a novel. The initial segment of the novel, titled "Jean de Florette", was an investigation of the foundation for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called "L'Eau des collines" (The Water of the Hills). Berri went over Pagnol's book by chance in a lodging, and was enraptured by it. He chose that so as to do the story equity it must be made in two sections. 

"Jean de Florette" was shot in and around the Vaucluse bureau of Provence, where various better places have been referenced as taping areas. La Treille, east of Marseille, in the Bouches-du-RhÄ'ne division, was where Pagnol had shot the first film. The town is presently inside the city furthest reaches of Marseille and has experienced broad improvement since the 1950s, so Berri needed to discover choices. For the town of the story he settled on Mirabeau (65Ã¢Â km toward the north), while Jean de Florette's home is situated in Vaugines, where the congregation from the film can likewise be found. The market scenes were taped in SommiÄÂ¨res in the Gard, and the story's Les Romarins was actually Riboux in the Var. 

Broad work was put into making a certified and verifiably right environment for the film. The veneers of the places of Mirabeau must be supplanted with painted polystyrene, to make them look more seasoned, and every electric wire were put underground. In the interim, in Vaugines, Berri planted twelve olive trees a year prior to shooting began, and watered them all through the holding up period, and for the second portion planted 10,000 carnations on the homestead. 

"Jean de Florette" and "Manon des Sources" were recorded together, over a time of thirty weeks, from May to December 1985. This permitted Berri to demonstrate the sensational occasional changes of the ProvenÄÂ§al scene. At $17 million, it was at the time the most costly film venture in French history. The long shooting time frame and the always expanding cost put an extraordinary weight on the performing artists, a significant number of whom regularly needed to come back to Paris for TV or theater work. When finished, the arrival of the film was an incredible national occasion. A unique special screening before the film's authentic discharge 27 August 1986, was gone to by then Minister of Culture Jack Lang. The melodic score is based around the aria Invano Alvaro from Giuseppe Verdi's 1862 musical drama "La forza del destino". 

The film was an incredible accomplishment in its local France, where it was seen by more than seven million individuals. It additionally performed very well globally; in the United States it earned almost five million US$, putting it among the 100 most financially fruitful unknown dialect films appeared. 

Basic gathering for "Jean de Florette" was generally positive. 

Rita Kempley, composing for "The Washington Post", contrasted the story with the fiction of William Faulkner. Permitting that it could without a doubt be "a conclusive French masterwork", she held judgment until after the debut of the second part, as "Jean de Florette" was just a "half-motion picture", "a long, methodic development, a punctiliously paced bother". 

Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" remarked on Berri's investigation of human character, "the perseverance of human avarice, the inclination that the land is so vital the human soul can be relinquished to it". Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars. 

The staff commentator for the amusement magazine "Assortment" featured Ã¢ÂÂ as different analysts did also Ã¢ÂÂ the cinematography of Bruno Nuytten (an exertion that won Nuytten a BAFTA grant and a "CÄÅ¡sar" assignment). The commentator praised Berri especially for the work finished with the little cast, and for his choice to remain consistent with Pagnol's unique story. Richard Bernstein, investigating the film for "The New York Times", composed it was "like no other film you've found as of late". He considered it a refreshed, quicker paced variant of Pagnol, where the first was as yet conspicuous. The paper records the film among the "Best 1000 Movies Ever Made". 

Later surveys demonstrate that the film has confronted the progression of time. Tasha Robinson, inspecting the DVD arrival of the two movies for "The A.V. Club" in 2007, called the scene, as depicted by Berri and Nuytten, "horrendously wonderful". Evaluating the movies 'A', she called them "shockingly tight and nimble" for a four-hour film cycle. 

Assigned for a sum of eight "CÄÅ¡sar" grants in 1987 Ã¢ÂÂ including 'Best Film', 'Best Director' and 'Best Cinematography' Ã¢ÂÂ "Jean de Florette" won just one, 'Best Actor' for Daniel Auteuil. 

At the BAFTA grants the following year it fared better, winning honors for 'Best Actor in a Supporting Role' (Auteuil), 'Best Cinematography', 'Best Film' and 'Best Adapted Screenplay'. The movie additionally earned six additional designations, including both Depardieu and Montand in the 'Best Actor'- classification, just as 'Best Direction' and 'Best Foreign Language Film'. 

Among different distinctions for the film were a U.S. National Board of Review grant for 'Best Foreign Language Film', and a 'Best Foreign Language Film' assignment at the 1988 Golden Globes. It was additionally assigned for the Golden Prize at the fifteenth Moscow International Film Festival. 

"Jean de Florette" and "Manon des Sources" have been translated as a major aspect of a more extensive pattern during the 1980s of purported 'legacy film': period pieces and ensemble shows that commended the history, culture and scene of France. It was the official approach of President FranÄÂ§ois Mitterrand, chose in 1981, and especially his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to advance these sorts of movies through expanded subsidizing of the sickly French film industry. Berri's pair of movies remain as the most noticeable case of this exertion. It has additionally been recommended that the treatment given the outcast Jean de Florette by local people was emblematic of the developing prominence of the counter migration development, driven by legislators like Jean-Marie Le Pen. 

The two movies are frequently found related to Peter Mayle's book "A Year in Provence", as causing expanded enthusiasm for, and the travel industry to, the area of Provence, especially among the British. The movies motivated a dream of the territory as a position of provincial genuineness, and were trailed by an expansion in British home proprietorship in southern France. As late as 2005, the proprietors of the house having a place with Jean de Florette in the film were as yet vexed by voyagers trespassing on their property. 

"Jean de Florette" filled in as a motivation for the 1998 MalayalamÃ¢ÂÂlanguage Indian film "Oru Maravathoor Kanavu".
