2001 Atlantic tropical storm season 

The 2001 Atlantic sea tempest season was a genuinely dynamic Atlantic typhoon season that delivered 17 tropical violent winds, 15 named tempests, nine storms, and four noteworthy sea tempests. The season formally kept going from June 1, 2001, to November 30, 2001, dates which by show limit the time of every year when tropical violent winds will in general structure in the Atlantic Ocean bowl. The season started with Tropical Storm Allison on June 4, and finished with Hurricane Olga, which scattered on December 6. The most extreme tempest was Hurricane Michelle, which accomplished Category 4 quality on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂSimpson Hurricane Scale. 

The most harming tempests of the period were Tropical Storm Allison, which caused broad flooding in Texas, Hurricane Iris, which struck Belize, and Hurricane Michelle, which influenced a few nations. Three tropical twisters made landfall on the United States, three legitimately influenced Canada, and three straightforwardly influenced Mexico and Central America. By and large, the season caused 117 fatalities, and $11.3 billion (2001 USD) in harm. Because of their serious harm, the names "Allison", "Iris", and "Michelle" were resigned by the World Meteorological Organization. 

Conjectures of sea tempest action are issued before every tropical storm season by noted typhoon specialists Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Dark, and their partners at Colorado State University; and independently by NOAA forecasters. 

Klotzbach's group (previously driven by Gray) characterized the normal number of tempests per season (1950 to 2000) as 9.6Ã¢Â tropical tempests, 5.9Ã¢Â hurricanes, 2.3Ã¢Â major sea tempests (storms coming to in any event CategoryÃ¢Â 3 quality in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) and ACE Index 96.1. NOAA characterizes a season as better than average, close typical or beneath ordinary by a mix of the quantity of named storms, the number achieving sea tempest quality, the number achieving serious tropical storm quality and ACE Index. 

On December 7, 2000, Gray's group issued its previously broadened range conjecture for the 2001 season, foreseeing better than expected action (13 named tempests, 8 sea tempests, and around 4 of Category 3 or higher). It recorded a 63 percent possibility of no less than one noteworthy tropical storm striking the U.S. terrain. This incorporated a 43 percent possibility of no less than one noteworthy tropical storm strike on the East Coast, including the Florida landmass, and a 36 percent shot of no less than one such strike on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle westbound. The potential for serious typhoon action in the Caribbean was conjecture to close average. 

On April 5, 2001, another gauge was issued, calling for 12 named tempests, 7 sea tempests, and 3 noteworthy tropical storms. The expansion in the estimate was credited to the warm ocean surface temperatures, in spite of the fact that the organization noticed that the season would likely not be as dynamic as past ones because of the impact of a frail to direct El Nino. The assessed potential for no less than one noteworthy typhoon to influence the U.S. was increased marginally to 65 percent; the East Coast potential additionally went up somewhat, and from the Florida Panhandle westbound to Brownsville, Texas, the likelihood remained almost the equivalent. 

On August 7, 2001, Gray's group issued their first mid-season gauge for the 2001 season, keeping the estimate number at 12 named tempests, with 7 getting to be sea tempests and 3 turning into a noteworthy typhoon, taking note of that ocean surface temperatures and ocean level weights kept on being ideal for better than expected storm action. The assessed potential for something like one noteworthy tropical storm to influence the U.S. was increased marginally by and by to 69 percent; the East Coast potential additionally went up somewhat to half, and from the Florida Panhandle westbound to Brownsville, Texas, the likelihood was likewise increased marginally. 

On August 8, 2001, NOAA reconsidered its season gauge marginally upwards to nine to twelve named storms, of which 6 to 8 were to be tropical storms, and 2 to 4 noteworthy typhoons. The organization noticed that ocean surface temperatures kept on being positive for better than expected storm movement, and because of the probability that El Nino would not create amid the pinnacle of the period, there was a diminished probability of an underneath normal year. 

The season's movement was reflected with a gathered typhoon vitality (ACE) rating of 110. Expert is, extensively, a proportion of the intensity of the tropical storm increased by the time span it existed, so storms that keep going quite a while, just as especially solid typhoons, have high ACEs. Pro is determined for full warnings on tropical frameworks at or surpassing 34Ã¢Â knots (39Ã¢Â mph, 63Ã¢Â km/h) or hurricane quality. Subtropical twisters, including the last bit of Allison and the underlying parts of Karen, Noel, and Olga, are rejected from the aggregate. 

Hurricane Allison created from a tropical wave in the northern Gulf of Mexico on June 4, 2001, and struck the northern Texas coast presently. It floated northward through the state, swung toward the south, and reemerged the Gulf of Mexico. The tempest proceeded towards the east-upper east, made landfall on Louisiana and after that moved over the southeast United States and Mid-Atlantic. Allison was the principal storm since Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to influence the northern Texas coastline. 

The tempest was a noteworthy flood calamity all through its way from Texas to the Mid-Atlantic. The most exceedingly bad of the flooding happened in Houston, Texas, where over 35Ã¢Â in (890Ã¢Â mm) of downpour fell when Allison slowed down over southeastern Texas. The tempest slaughtered 41Ã¢Â people, including 27 who suffocated. The tempest additionally caused $8.5Ã¢Â billion in harm (2001ÃÂ USD), making it the costliest and second-deadliest typhoon on record in the United States. Allison demolished 2,744Ã¢Â homes, leaving 30,000Ã¢Â homeless, with private harms totaling to $1.76Ã¢Â billion (2001ÃÂ USD). 

A tropical dejection shaped from a low dimension course on July 11, well toward the east of the Windward Islands. It achieved a most extreme quality of 30Ã¢Â mph (45Ã¢Â km/h), with a weight of , however vertical breeze shear from a subtropical edge toward the north made it disperse on July 12. It kicked the bucket in one day. 

On July 24, a tropical wave got off the shore of Africa and followed westbound. The wave entered the Caribbean on July 29 and picked up in association and convection, and composed into Tropical Storm Barry on August 3. After variances in force, the framework achieved crest winds of 70Ã¢Â mph (110Ã¢Â km/h) in the Gulf of Mexico, and traveled northward before moving aground along the Gulf Coast. 

The tempest influenced Florida; precipitation crested at Tallahassee, and winds blasts beat out at . Three individuals in Florida were murdered by the tempest, and all out harm is evaluated at around $30Ã¢Â million (2001ÃÂ USD). 

Hurricane Chantal created from a tropical wave on AugustÃ¢Â 14 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It followed quickly westbound for quite a bit of its span, and subsequent to deteriorating into a tropical wave it went through the Windward Islands. Chantal improved and achieved a pinnacle force of 70Ã¢Â mph (110Ã¢Â km/h) twice in the Caribbean Sea, and each time, wind shear and later land association avoided fortifying to tropical storm status. On AugustÃ¢Â 21 Chantal moved aground close to the fringe of Mexico and Belize, and it disseminated the following day. 

The tempest created a breeze whirlwind (115Ã¢Â km/h) in Caye Caulker, albeit more grounded breezes were conceivable in a convective band toward the north. On the Yucatan Peninsula, substantial precipitation prompted mudslides crosswise over Quintana Roo, abandoning a few territories disengaged. 

A tropical wave generated Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 over the Lesser Antilles. Solid breeze shear immediately debilitated Dean to make it disseminate on August 23. The remainders turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 toward the north of Bermuda. Situated over warm waters and in a territory of good conditions, Dean relentlessly fortified while moving toward the upper east, and crested just underneath sea tempest status on August 27 southwest of Newfoundland. The tempest thusly debilitated over cooler waters, and moved toward becoming extratropical on August 28. Hurricane Dean softly influenced Newfoundland, however no harms were accounted for. 

Sea tempest Erin created from a tropical wave on September 1, and fortified to a 60Ã¢Â mph (95Ã¢Â km/h) hurricane as it moved toward the west-northwest. In the wake of debilitating because of wind shear, the remainders re-composed into a tropical gloom the following day, and Erin reinforced into a storm on September 9 while moving northwestward. The typhoon immediately heightened and achieved top breezes of 120Ã¢Â mph (195Ã¢Â km/h) later on September 9. A trough swung Erin toward the upper east, and subsequent to passing only east of Cape Race, Newfoundland it moved toward becoming extratropical on September 15. The extratropical remainder proceeded with northeastward and lost its character close Greenland on September 17. Storm Erin brushed Newfoundland, delivering a continued breeze of 53Ã¢Â mph (85Ã¢Â km/h) with a whirlwind (108Ã¢Â km/h) at Cape Race. Along the coast, the entry of the tempest prompted wave statures of up to 30Ã¢Â ft (9.3Ã¢Â m). 

A tropical wave produced a tropical sadness on SeptemberÃ¢Â 7 close to the Cape Verde islands, which declined once more into a tropical wave the following day because of solid shear. It redeveloped over into a tropical sorrow on SeptemberÃ¢Â 10, and escalated into Tropical Storm Felix the following day while following commonly northward. By SeptemberÃ¢Â 13, it escalated into a storm, and in this manner it experienced fast extending, turning into a noteworthy sea tempest on SeptemberÃ¢Â 14 with pinnacle winds of . At that point, Felix had swung toward the upper east, and accordingly entered a zone of troublesome conditions. The typhoon step by step debilitated, falling apart to a hurricane on SeptemberÃ¢Â 17. Cool waters and higher breeze shear caused extra debilitating while Felix about slowed down toward the southwest of the Azores. Late on SeptemberÃ¢Â 18, the tempest debilitated to a tropical melancholy, and promptly the following day Felix disseminated. 

Storm Gabrielle started in a powerless low-to mid-level trough that was about stationary a short separation off the southeastern coastline of the United States. A cut off low shaped over Florida on September 9, and a related surface low weight framework framed, that was before long assigned Tropical Depression Eight. The tempest bit by bit strengthened, and made landfall on Florida before rising into the Atlantic Ocean and quickening northeastward, as it achieved crest force as a negligible typhoon. 

Sea tempest Gabrielle created moderate breezes along beach front zones of western Florida, coming to at Venice. The tide overwhelmed the northern shoreline of Charlotte Harbor and at the passage to the Peace River, while further toward the south a flood of more prominent than immersed the boundary island at Fort Myers Beach and overflowed a few vehicles. Gabrielle brushed the eastern bank of Newfoundland; the precipitation set the untouched six-hour precipitation record at St. John's, with an aggregate of . Many homes and structures were harmed by the entry of Gabrielle, totaling a few million Canadian dollars in harm. 

A tropical despondency framed from a tropical wave in the Caribbean on September 19, north-northwest of San Andres Island. It accomplished a most extreme quality of , and made landfall close Puerto Cabezas on September 20. In the wake of losing its shut flow over land, it changed into Hurricane Juliette in the East Pacific. 

Typhoon Humberto shaped from a territory of low weight produced by Hurricane Gabrielle. The low shaped into a tropical wretchedness on September 21 while south of Bermuda, following northwest, and was named Tropical Storm Humberto the following day. It started moving north, and afterward upper east as it passed Bermuda and reinforced into a sea tempest. Humberto headed over the colder waters of the far north Atlantic Ocean, and dispersed rapidly on September 27. 

Tropical Depression Eleven framed only southeast of Barbados on October 4. It traversed the Windward Islands, and was named Tropical Storm Iris while south of Puerto Rico on October 5. Iris proceeded toward the west and escalated. In the wake of passing only south of Jamaica, Iris came to CategoryÃ¢Â 4 sea tempest quality, and made landfall close Monkey River Town, Belize on October 9 at CategoryÃ¢Â 4 quality, however debilitated quickly. It dispersed soon thereafter. 

The tempest created a tempest flood. Various homes were demolished, and the banana crop endured broad harm. A precise loss of life is obscure, however 31 are affirmed dead, three in the Dominican Republic, eight in Guatemala, and 20 from the M/V "Wave Dancer", a ship that upset off the Belize coast. 

Typhoon Jerry framed as a tropical sadness from a tropical wave on October 6 close Barbados. The tempest increased into a hurricane promptly the next day on October 7 while at first situated under a domain of powerless vertical breeze shear. In the wake of achieving its pinnacle of 50Ã¢Â mph (80Ã¢Â km/h), Jerry passed only south of Barbados late on October 7 and through the Windward Islands on October 8. Disintegration in association happened, and Jerry disseminated while moving quickly westbound well south of Puerto Rico. 

A virus front and an upper dimension trough interfaced on October 10 toward the south of Bermuda, and framed an extratropical storm. The tempest go close Bermuda on October 12, creating tropical storm compel twists on the island. It at that point composed, turning into a subtropical twister on October 12 and a tropical typhoon on October 13. Karen fortified to achieve 80Ã¢Â mph (130Ã¢Â km/h) twists as a CategoryÃ¢Â 1 typhoon on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂSimpson Hurricane Scale, and in the wake of debilitating over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a typhoon. It rapidly progressed toward becoming extratropical. 

Typhoon Karen created light to direct breezes crosswise over Atlantic Canada, topping at 47Ã¢Â mph (76Ã¢Â km/h) with a whirlwind (103Ã¢Â km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, alongside a 26Ã¢Â mph (42Ã¢Â km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Afterward, in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, the tempest framework that retained Hurricane Noel created solid breezes that brought down a few trees and electrical cables which brought about power blackouts. 

An upper-level tropospheric trough persevered in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, building up a course by October 26 which immediately sorted out. On October 27, it formed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about 860Ã¢Â miles (1380Ã¢Â kilometers) south-southwest of the western Azores. Moving westbound, the discouragement was estimate to accomplish winds of at any rate 60Ã¢Â mph (95Ã¢Â km/h), in spite of the fact that it neglected to achieve that power. Banding highlights created over the tempest, and on October 30 it was moved up to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By at an early stage October 31, convection had started to isolate from the dissemination, and later in the day Lorenzo progressed toward becoming extratropical; presently, its leftovers converged with a frontal framework about 690Ã¢Â mi (1,110Ã¢Â km) west of the Azores. 

Sea tempest Michelle created from a tropical wave that moved over the Atlantic, and framed into a tropical gloom on October 29. Convection expanded, and the framework shaped into Tropical Storm Michelle on November 1. It reinforced further, achieving its pinnacle quality as a Category 4. One of just four November Category 4 tropical storms, Michelle made landfall on south-focal Cuba with winds of 140Ã¢Â mph (225Ã¢Â km/h), the most grounded Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic typhoon season. 

The framework that in the long run progressed toward becoming Hurricane Michelle dropped exuberant rains in a few nations, causing six passings in Honduras and four passings in Nicaragua, with a broad yet obscure measure of harm. An extra 26 individuals were accounted for missing in Central America. Michelle proceeded to influence Cuba, where the tempest created waves, alongside an overwhelming tempest flood. Precipitation sums up to 29.69Ã¢Â in (754Ã¢Â mm) were recorded over the island. 

A non-tropical frontal low created from a virus front on November 1 toward the west of the Azores. It heightened while moving west-northwestward and bit by bit dispersed its frontal structure. It turned into a subtropical tempest on November 4 around 775 nautical miles (1435Ã¢Â km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Operationally, the tempest was considered a non-tropical low, and the National Hurricane Center did not start issuing warnings until it turned into a tropical tornado. It moved gradually northward as convection sorted out into a ring around the middle. Because of a ship detailing tropical storm constrain twists close to the inside, and because of the advancement of a powerless mid-level warm center, the subtropical typhoon was renamed as Hurricane Noel on November 5. Expanding westerly wind shear restricted convection close to the inside, and Noel debilitated to a typhoon right off the bat November 6. Logically cooler water temperatures added to debilitating, and Noel progressed toward becoming extratropical later on November 6 about 330Ã¢Â mi (530Ã¢Â km) southeast of Newfoundland. The extratropical leftover proceeded toward the upper east and was consumed by a bigger extratropical storm soon thereafter. 

Tropical storm Olga framed as a subtropical tornado on November 24 and wandered westbound where it achieved sea tempest status on November 26. The tempest achieved top breezes of 90Ã¢Â mph (150Ã¢Â km/h) before transforming southeastward and debilitating once more into a typhoon. Olga dispersed as a tropical tornado on December 6 east of the Bahamas.

The accompanying names were utilized for named storms that shaped in the north Atlantic in 2001. The names not resigned from this rundown were utilized again in the 2007 season. This is a similar rundown utilized for the 1995 season aside from Lorenzo, Michelle, Olga, and Rebekah, which supplanted Luis, Marilyn, Opal, and Roxanne. Tempests were named Lorenzo, Michelle, and Olga for the solitary, (on account of Michelle) time in 2001. Names that were designated for the 2001 season yet were not alloted are set apart in . 

The World Meteorological Organization resigned three names in the spring of 2002: Allison, Iris, and Michelle. They were supplanted in the 2007 season by Andrea, Ingrid, and Melissa. Allison turned into the principal Atlantic typhoon to have its name resigned.
