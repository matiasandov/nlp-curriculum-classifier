Will discovers Jack and the group on an island and liberates them from savages. Soon after, Governor Swann liberates Elizabeth from prison, yet he is then caught. Elizabeth deals with Beckett to discover the compass. Masked as a lodge kid on board a Scottish shipper vessel, she advances toward Tortuga where she later discovers Jack and furthermore a tanked Norrington. In the wake of getting away from the savages, Jack and the team visit voodoo priestess Tia Dalma, who uncovers Jones' shortcoming is his heart, which is bolted inside the Dead Man's Chest.

Will meets his dad on board the "Dutchman" and discovers that Jones has the way to the chest. They play a round of Liar's Dice against Jones to attempt and win the key, however they lose. Regardless of this, Will escapes with the key and is taken on board a similar ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him, sinking the ship, yet Will get away. 

In Tortuga, Jack enlists another group, including Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's utilization of Jack's compass, they can find the chest. All gatherings land on Isla Cruces, where the chest is covered, yet a three-way sword battle breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all need the heart for their particular objectives: Jack needs to cancel the Kraken; Will needs to save his dad; and Norrington needs to recapture his life as a Navy officer.

Following the accomplishment of "" (2003), the cast and team marked on for two additional spin-offs of be shot consecutive, a pragmatic choice on Disney's part to permit additional time with a similar cast and group. Author Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio chose not to make the spin-offs new undertakings highlighting similar characters, as with the "Indiana Jones" and "James Bond" arrangement, however to retroactively turn "The Curse of the Black Pearl" into the first of a set of three. They needed to investigate the truth of what might occur after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's grip toward the finish of the principal film, and at first thought about the Fountain of Youth as the plot gadget. They settled on presenting Davy Jones, the "Flying Dutchman" and the Kraken. They additionally presented the verifiable East India Trading Company, who for them spoke to a contradiction to the subjects of individual flexibility spoken to by privateers. 

Arranging started in June 2004, and creation was a lot bigger than "The Curse of the Black Pearl", which was just shot on area in St. Vincent. This time, the continuations would require completely working boats, with a working "Dark Pearl" worked over the body of an oil tanker in Bayou La Batre, Alabama. By November, the content was as yet incomplete as the scholars did not need chief Gore Verbinski and maker Jerry Bruckheimer to bargain what they had composed, so Verbinski worked with James Byrkit to storyboard significant successions without need of a content, while Elliott and Rossio composed a "preliminary" content for the team to use before they completed the content they were content with. By January 2005, with increasing expenses and no content, Disney took steps to drop the film, however altered their opinions. The authors would go with the group on area, feeling that the delay of their reworks would improve the immediacy of the cast's exhibitions. 

Important photography started on February 28, 2005, in Palos Verdes, starting with Elizabeth's demolished wedding day. The team spent the primary shooting days at Walt Disney Studios in Los Angeles, including the insides of the "Dark Pearl" and the "Edinburgh Trader" which Elizabeth stows away on, before moving to St. Vincent to shoot the scenes in Port Royal and Tortuga. Sets from the past film were reused, having endure three storms, in spite of the fact that the primary dock must be remade as it had crumpled in November. The group had four tall boats available to them to populate the foundations, which were painted contrastingly on each side for economy. One of the boats utilized was the imitation of HMS "Abundance" utilized in the 1962 film adjustment of "Uprising on the Bounty". 

On April 18, 2005, the team started shooting at Dominica, an area Verbinski had chosen as he felt it fitted the feeling of remoteness he was searching for. Be that as it may, this was additionally an issue; the Dominican government were totally caught off guard for the size of a Hollywood creation, as while the 500-in number group involving around 90% of the streets on the island they experienced difficulty moving around on the immature surfaces. The climate additionally switched back and forth between heavy rainstorms and hot temperatures, the last of which was exacerbated for the cast who needed to wear period apparel. At Dominica, the groupings including Pelegosto (Cannibal Island) and the woodland fragment of the fight on Isla Cruces were shot. Verbinski liked to utilize useful props for the mammoth haggle confine successions, groping long close shots would help further suspend the gathering of people's mistrust. Dominica was likewise utilized for Tia Dalma's shack. Recording on the island closed on May 26, 2005. 

The group moved to a little island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the start and end of the Isla Cruces fight, before generation enjoyed a reprieve until August, where in Los Angeles the insides of the "Flying Dutchman" were shot. On September 18, 2005, the group moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot dispatch outsides, including the working "Dark Pearl" and "Flying Dutchman".

Recording finished on September 10, 2005. 

The "Flying Dutchman"s team individuals were initially brought about by essayists Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio as phantoms, yet Gore Verbinski detested this and planned them as physical animals. Their order is reflected by how changed they were: newcomers had low dimension contaminations which look like rosacea, while veterans had out and out undersea animal traits. Verbinski needed to keep them practical, dismissing a character with a turtle shell, and the illustrators viewed different David Attenborough documentaries to ponder the development of ocean anemones and mussels. The majority of the group are PC created, except for Stellan SkarsgÄÄ¾rd, who played "Bootstrap" Bill Turner. At first his prosthetics would be increased with CGI yet that was deserted. SkarsgÄÄ¾rd went through four hours in the make-up seat and was named "Bouillabaisse" on set. 

Skipper Davy Jones had initially been planned with jaw developments, before the originators made the move to all out limbs; the skin of the character fuses the surface of an espresso recolored Styrofoam glass among different components. To depict Jones on set, Bill Nighy wore a movement catch tracksuit that implied the artists at Industrial Light and Magic did not need to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the movement catch organize. Nighy wore make-up around his eyes and mouth to join into the PC produced shots, yet the pictures of his eyes and mouth were not utilized. Nighy just wore a prosthetic once, with blue-hued appendages for when Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) takes the way to the Dead Man's Chest from under his "whiskers" as he dozes. To make the CG adaptation of the character, the model was firmly founded on a full-body output of Nighy, with Jones mirroring his high cheekbones. Artists contemplated each edge of Nighy's execution: the on-screen character himself had favored them by making his execution more peculiar than anticipated, giving interminable amusing to them. His execution likewise implied new controls must be put away. At long last, Jones' arms are for the most part a recreation, however on occasion they were hand-enlivened when they go about as appendages for the character. 

The Kraken was hard to invigorate as it had no genuine reference, until movement chief Hal Hickel educated the team to watch "Ruler Kong versus Godzilla" which had a genuine octopus creeping over miniatures. On the set, two channels loaded up with 30,000 pounds of concrete were utilized to crash and part the "Edinburgh Trader": Completing the figment are scaled down poles and falling doubles shot on a bluescreen arrange. The scene where the Kraken spits at Jack Sparrow does not utilize PC created spit: it was genuine gunge tossed at Johnny Depp.

Empire magazine gave the film 3 stars saying "Depp is by and by an unmitigated happiness as Captain Sparrow, conveying another eye-shooting, word-slurring turn with some awesome droll twists.
