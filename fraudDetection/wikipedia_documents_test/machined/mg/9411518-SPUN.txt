64th (second Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot 

The 64th (second Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot was an infantry regiment of the British Army. The regiment was made as the second Battalion, eleventh Regiment of Foot in 1756, redesignated as the 64th Regiment of Foot in 1758, and took a region title as the 64th (second Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot in 1782. Following the Cardwell Reforms the regiment amalgamated with the 98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot to turn into The Prince of Wales' (North Staffordshire Regiment) in 1881. In the new regiment the 64th Foot turned into the first Battalion because of its rank over the 98th Foot. 

In spite of the fact that the 64th Foot battled in huge numbers of the significant clashes of the late eighteenth and mid nineteenth hundreds of years, it was regularly in the more minor auditoriums of these contentions. Amid the Seven Years' War it served in the West Indies; in the Napoleonic Wars, its job was restricted, once more, toward the West Indies and South America. In the mid-nineteenth century, it battled in the Anglo-Persian War and the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where one of its troopers was granted the Victoria Cross. 

The arrangement of the 64th Foot was incited by the development of the military because of the beginning of the Seven Years' War. On 25 August 1756 it was requested that various existing regiments should raise a second contingent; among those picked was the eleventh Regiment of Foot. The second Battalion of the eleventh Foot was raised at Southampton on 10 December 1756 preceding moving to Newcastle upon Tyne. On 21 April 1758 the War Office requested that the second units raised two years already ought to be turned out to be autonomous regiments in their own privilege and on that day the second Battalion eleventh Foot turned into the 64th Foot. Soon after King George II requested that the dates of position of the 64th Foot and different regiments made on 21 April 1758 ought to be antedated to the date of their raising as second forces, thusly the date status of the 64th Foot ended up 1756. The primary colonel of the regiment was the Honorable John Barrington and it was he who chosen that the facings of the 64th Foot ought to be dark. 

Very quickly in the wake of turning into the 64th Foot, the regiment was sent toward the West Indies. Upon entry, in 1759, it partook in the ineffective endeavor to take Martinique and after that in the fruitful attack of Guadeloupe. Investment in this activity earned the regiment its first fight respect "Guadaloupe 1759", however this respect was not really granted until 1909. The regiment came back to England in June 1759 seriously decreased in numbers by men drafted to different units and by tropical ailment. On landing in Portsmouth just 137 different positions out of a foundation quality of 790 were fit for obligation, however officer quality was nearly up to quality. Recuperation took quite a while and after a concise period in Suffolk the regiment went through three years in the Scottish Highlands and five years in Ireland before cruising for North America in 1768. 

The main posting for the 64th in America was Boston, at the time a focal point of discontent and a troubled posting subsequently. In 1770 the regiment moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia however in 1772 came back to Boston being positioned at Castle William. 

As distress became the 64th occurred in an occurrence which lays a case to the primary blood of the American War of Independence being shed in Salem, Massachusetts. On 26 February 1775 a supply of weapons and ammo was known to be in Salem. The 64th, under their officer Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Leslie, were requested to catch the weapons. American nationalists in Salem were admonished and endeavored to avert the 64th from completing their requests. In the fight that resulted a neighborhood Salem man, Joseph Whicher, was somewhat harmed by a British blade. Arrangements counteracted any further gore and the 64th pulled back to Boston, their main goal a disappointment. 

On the episode of threats in April 1775, the 64th was still positioned at Castle William and stayed there as the army all through the Siege of Boston. Thus, the regiment did not participate in the Battle of Bunker Hill. At the point when, in March 1776, the British deserted Boston, the 64th were the last regiment to leave for Halifax, giving them the refinement of being the last British unit to set foot in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts amid the war. 

Following the revamping of the military the 64th, as most regiments, ended up without its flank (grenadier and light infantry) organizations which had been segregated to frame some portion of the second Grenadier and second Light Infantry Battalions individually. Every one of the three legions partook in the 1776 catch of New York and the 64th was occupied with the later Battle of Ridgefield. 

In 1777 each of the three units took an interest in the Philadelphia crusade, participating in the Battle of Brandywine, the Battle of Paoli and the Battle of Germantown. Staying in Philadelphia over the winter and into 1778, the 64th and second Grenadier Battalion framed piece of the rearguard when Lieutenant-General Clinton cleared the city in June 1778. Coming back to New York, the 64th partook in a few little activities. The Light organization participated in the engagement that wound up known as the Baylor Massacre. 

November 1779 saw every one of the organizations of the regiment being exchanged toward the Southern performance center of tasks. In April 1780 the 64th was a piece of the covering power assaulting Charleston, while the grenadier and light organizations framed piece of the fundamental attack constrain. After the catch of Charleston, the grenadier and light organizations were pulled back to New York and as Major-General Cornwallis progressed on Virginia, the 64th stayed in Carolina as watchman troops. In 1781 the 64th were engaged with the Battle of Eutaw Springs and after a year in one of the last activities of the war, the Battle of the Combahee River. The grenadier organization was brought together with the 64th yet the light organization was among the units that surrendered with Cornwallis at Yorktown. 

In December 1782 the regiment left America for Jamaica. Back in England, a change happened in armed force arrangement, to ideally increment enlisting, infantry regiments were given extra regional titles. The 64th turned into the 64th (second Staffordshire) Foot and started its long relationship with the city of Lichfield as the stop organizations moved there and not long after started to wear the Staffordshire Knot on its uniform. 

Following the annihilation in America, the 64th stayed in Jamaica for a long time, coming back to England in 1783. After four years the regiment was positioned in Ireland, before cruising afresh for the West Indies in 1793 at the episode of the Napoleonic Wars. Toward the finish of the Seven Years' War both Martinique and Guadeloupe had been come back to France under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. From Barbados the 64th Foot partook in the intrusion of Martinique in mid 1794. As before the flank organizations were withdrawn from the remainder of the regiment yet each of the three components were engaged with the activities in Martinique. This short yet fruitful crusade earned the regiment its second fight respect, "Martinique 1794"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂalthough similarly as with the prior Guadeloupe respect, it was not really granted until 1909. 

The light and grenadier organizations were engaged with the catch, presently a short time later, of St Lucia and the recover of Guadeloupe. A brief period as battalion obligation pursued and after that the regiment came back to England, seriously debilitated by the two misfortunes in fight and disorder, generally yellow fever. Sir Charles Gray, leader of the British powers in the West Indies, evaluated that he had lost 5,000 out of 7,000 troops in under a half year. 

The regiment came back to England in 1795, preceding moving to Gibraltar and after that Ireland, where it had a minor influence in smothering the 1798 disobedience. The 64th came back to England in 1800. 

Inside months the 64th had come back toward the West Indies for a crusade of catching islands held by, differently, France, The Netherlands and Denmark. The main island to fall was the Franco-Dutch island of Saint Martin. This was trailed by the Dutch island of St Eustatius and the Danish islands of Saint Thomas, Saint John and Saint Croix. With the marking of the Treaty of Amiens, which reestablished to France and its partners all regions vanquished by the British, the 64th were pulled back to Barbados. Harmony did not keep going long and in 1803 war with France broke out once more. The 64th was quickly in real life being a piece of an expeditionary power that took St Lucia, acquiring the fight respect "St Lucia 1803"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ the honor of this respect was all the more auspicious, it being granted in 1818. The endeavor proceeded onto the South American territory with the catch of Dutch held Surinam in 1804. A fourth fight respect, "Surinam", was awardedÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ again in 1818. Army obligations kept the 64th in Surinam for the following nine years implying that the regiment had no further influence in the Napoleonic Wars. 

A move to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1813 found the 64th giving the memorial service watchman to James Lawrence, Captain of the USS Chesapeake after the catch of the Chesapeake. In 1815 the regiment came back to Europe to be sent to France as a feature of the Army of Occupation after the Battle of Waterloo. 

It was to be 1856 preceding the regiment ended up on dynamic administration once more. In the meantime there had been a short spell in England, a long posting in Gibraltar, quite a while in Ireland, an additional six-year visit in the West IndiesÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ where indeed fever caused much affliction. These were trailed by a short three-year visit in Canada which gave one thing of note. On the voyage home two organizations, under the order of Captain James Draper, and around 100 ladies and youngsters were ready the barque "Alert" when the ship hit a reef around 100 miles out of Halifax. The ship was refloated however in an overwhelming ocean was in danger of sinking and was taking on water. The ace of the "Alert" chose that the main game-plan was to shoreline the vessel however was stressed that the ship was getting to be top substantial as the troops and their families made for the upper deck. Commander Draper and the troops were convinced to stay on the troop deck in spite of the rising water level. The ship was stranded on a uninhabited island and all ready were later protected. The Duke of Wellington Commander-in-head of the British armed force coordinated that the tale of Captain Draper's separation be perused out to each regiment and corps in the military for instance of the prizes of relentlessness and order. The two organizations were brought together with the remainder of the regiment in England, serving in England and Ireland until being presented on India. Based here until 1856 it saw no dynamic administration regardless of being activated as a feature of a Reserve Field Force in Sindh in 1852. 

War among Britain and Persia broke out in 1856 and the 64th, together with the twentieth Bombay Native Infantry, framed the first Brigade in the expeditionary power amassed for the crusade. Arriving in Persia in late November, the regiment occurred in fights at Reshire and Bushire. In 1857 the power progressed inland and crushed the Persian field armed force at Koosh-Ab on 8 February 1857 while the flank organizations were associated with activity at Ahwaz. Despite the fact that threats went on for barely three months, four fight respects were granted; "Reshire", "Bushire", "Koosh-Ab" and "Persia". The 64th were the main British regiment to be granted every one of the four. 

Following the Persian crusade the 64th came back to India touching base in Bombay just two weeks after the principal turmoil had happened in Meerut. The regiment was quickly requested to participate in the Cawnpore alleviation constrain under Major-General Sir Henry Havelock. The alleviation compel did not reach Cawnpore before the city fell under dissident control, a constrained walk was along these lines requested and the primary conflict with the renegade powers happened at Fatehpur. From that point various clashes occurred until the power met with the agitators in a huge commitment at Ahwera on 16 July. It was for his activities in this fight Lieutenant Henry Havelock of the tenth Foot was granted the Victoria Cross. This honor made extensive discontent inside the 64th as the reference gathered that it was just due to Lt Havelock's activities that the regiment progressed and accomplished its destinations. The issue was alluded to Sir Colin Campbell, Commander in Chief, India who maintained the objection raised and voiced solid analysis of staff officersÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ Havelock was filling in as Aide-de-camp to his fatherÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ meddling with regimental officers carrying out their responsibility. The help drive entered Cawnpore on 17 July 1857. In this way, components of the regiment had a little impact in the help of Lucknow yet most of the regiment stayed in Cawnpore and it was here that, on 28 November 1857, Drummer Thomas Flinn won the main Victoria Cross granted to an individual from the regiment for handling two adversary artillerymen notwithstanding having been injured himself. Hence, the regiment moved to Fatehgarh and stayed there for the remainder of the battle until June 1859 when it came back to Bombay. A solitary fight respect "Lucknow" was granted to the regiment. 

On come back from India in 1861, the regiment went through six years in England, moving to Malta in 1867, at that point Ireland in 1872. In 1874, as a component of the Cardwell Reforms, line infantry units were connected in sets, and the 64th shaped a joint stop with the 98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot at Limerick. The two regiments were alloted as locale no. 20 with another stop at Whittington Barracks, Staffordshire in 1880. Up to 1879 the 64th was positioned in different pieces of the United Kingdom, regularly performing police obligations. The regiment came back to Ireland in 1879, based at Templemore, County Tipperary and it was based here when it was formally amalgamated with the 98th to turn into the Prince of Wales' (North Staffordshire) Regiment on 1 July 1881. 

The regiment was renamed The North Staffordshire (The Prince of Wales's) Regiment in 1920. In 1959 the North Staffordshire and South Staffordshire Regiments amalgamated to frame The Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's). In September 2007 The Staffordshire Regiment amalgamated with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to frame The Mercian Regiment, in which the Staffords turned into the third (Staffordshire) Battalion. 

The dark facings worn by the 64th Foot are today honored by the utilization of dark sponsorship to chevrons and rank emblem by all Warrant Officers and Non-appointed officers of the Mercian Regiment.
