This was a sign well ahead of time that the was in line for a welcome to the race. Ballan was later suspended by his group because of an inside doping examination, which means he needed to miss the Giro. He was later cleared of any bad behavior. 

Most pre-race examinations recognized Ivan Basso, Cadel Evans, and Carlos Sastre as the real top choices to win the general grouping, with Evans maybe the agreement pick.

This set the phase for a fierce opening to the Giro, as both of the street race arranges in the Netherlands highlighted a few accidents. The courses for the street arranges in the Netherlands were noted to have a great deal of road furniture on them, which joined with the riders' nerves on the principal day of a three-week Grand Tour just as crosswinds from the North Sea to make the primary mass-begin organizes unsafe. Tyler Farrar, Carlos Sastre, Christian Vande Velde, Greg Henderson, Wiggins, Alessandro Petacchi, Domenico Pozzovivo, Marzio Bruseghin, Filippo Pozzato, and Gilberto Simoni all tumbled from their bicycles sooner or later while the Giro was in the Netherlands. There were additionally numerous different accidents that brought down such huge numbers of riders it was hard to monitor precisely who was affected.

For sprinters like Farrar and Petacchi, slamming implied they were probably not going to have the capacity to challenge the completions for stage wins, while by and large contenders like Wiggins and Sastre lost time in the general grouping. For the second year straight, Vandevelde endured a broken collarbone because of his accident, therefore deserting the race. In spite of slamming amid stage 2, Farrar got up and had the capacity to win the phase from an exhausted field dash. The condition of the streets in the Netherlands and the sheer amount of accidents that occurred there brought about much analysis and inquiries about whether they ought to be incorporated into a Grand Tour. Cadel Evans and Alexander Vinokourov both took the pink pullover while the Giro was in the Netherlands. Vinokourov held it before the exchange to Italy, with six riders from three groups inside 10 seconds of him, which means the pink shirt still stayed especially in motion. 

After the exchange, the primary stage in Italy was a group time preliminary, a race where every individual from the squad races with time as the opponent together, and the group's time is taken for the fifth rider to cross the end goal. was the triumphant squad, and had a period hole over Vinokourov's group that was adequately sufficiently vast for Vincenzo Nibali to turn into the fourth race pioneer in the same number of stages. Finally, there was soundness in the race administration, as Nibali serenely held throughout the following two phases, the two of which highlighted breakaways taking the day's distinctions while the peloton completed together. Stage 7 was a noteworthy one, consolidating stretches of rock streets close to the completion. The day on which this stage was run additionally happened to have overwhelming precipitation, making the course sloppy and hazardous. Much like had occurred in the Netherlands, a large number of riders smashed in this stage, maybe boss among them Wiggins and Sastre, who both lost over four minutes. Nibali additionally smashed, and after observing this, Alexander Vinokourov, Damiano Cunego, and Cadel Evans broke free of the main gathering. Evans won the stage, one of numerous riders to cross the end goal shrouded in mud, and Vinokourov reclaimed the race authority. Through the primary mountain stage and two level stages that pursued, the general standings did not change much, and Vinokourov held the pullover. 

Stage 11 into L'Aquila accommodated real changes to the general standings. In excess of 50 riders framed the day's break gathering, and they rapidly exploited. Among them were Sastre, Wiggins, and 's Richie Porte, who was holding the white pullover as best youthful rider and, at 6th by and large, was the best-set man in the gathering.

Sastre and Wiggins, who entered the Giro as contenders yet had fallen well back in the general standings before this stage, both moved again into the best ten. 

Porte kept the pink pullover for two days, surrendering it to David Arroyo, a kindred individual from the L'Aquila breakaway, in front of an audience 14 when he couldn't climb Monte Grappa with the pioneers on the day. On this stage, the race's general top picks started to crawl once again into the highest point of the general order, as past race pioneers Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans accepted eighth through tenth in the standings. There were again incredible changes to the general characterization in stage 15, by method for the move up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and enormously decreased his deficiency to Arroyo, however the Spaniard still held the pink shirt after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali likewise completed well-set and climbed. Wiggins again dropped out of dispute, this time definitively along these lines, by losing 25 minutes on the ascension. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race top picks in the Plan de Corones time preliminary, shutting his shortfall to Basso and moving past Sastre in the in general. After this stage, the main riders left in the best ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert KiÄºÄerlovski, who all completed the Giro in the best ten. 

After a phase each for the breakaway and the sprinters, amid which there were no real changes to the general standings, the riders were looked with the very climbing-escalated last two street stages. The group rode an extremely hard rhythm in stage 19 over the Passo del Mortirolo, which in the end trimmed that bunch down to simply Basso, Nibali, and Scarponi. They crossed the Mortirolo over two minutes in front of Arroyo, which was about sufficient opportunity to make Basso the virtual race pioneer. Arroyo, noted as an obviously better descender than Basso, brought exceptionally forceful lines descending the Mortirolo and made up for lost time with Vinokourov, Sastre, Evans, and John Gadret, who had been among him and the main trio. Basso's gathering had just 30 seconds on Arroyo's toward the beginning of the stage-closing Aprica climb, yet they took increasingly more time as the ascension went on and completed three minutes ahead, giving Basso the pink shirt with two days left to race. Arroyo chose not to endeavor to forcefully plunge any of the four extensive ascensions on course in the last street race organize, making due with second spot by riding with Basso and the other top riders in the peloton the greater part of the day. There were a couple of changes in time holes, however similar riders stayed in the main ten from the earlier day, as Johan Tschopp won the phase from a breakaway. The individual time preliminary in Verona which finished off the Giro additionally accommodated little changes to the generally speaking, yet Basso's fifteenth spot on the stage was effectively enough to make him Giro champion.
