"It's really illicit, on the grounds that they are fundamentally charging me for hands on preparing Ã¢ÂÂ in California you can't charge someone for hands on preparing. It's of no genuine esteem, yet you don't have the foggiest idea about that, when you're in Scientology. You believe, 'Are they going to embellish my wages, are they going to sue me?'
