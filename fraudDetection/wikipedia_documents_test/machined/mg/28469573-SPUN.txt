Huge numbers of the sonnets in "Diiie" were initially melody verses, composed amid Angelou's vocation as a dance club entertainer, and recorded on two collections before the distribution of Angelou's first personal history "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (1969). Angelou sees herself as a writer and a dramatist, yet is best known for her seven personal histories. From the get-go in her composition profession she started a routine with regards to rotating the distribution of a self-portrayal and a volume of verse. Despite the fact that her verse accumulations have been smash hits, they have not gotten genuine basic consideration and are all the more intriguing when perused so anyone might hear. 

"Diiie" is comprised of two segments of 38 ballads. The 20 lyrics in the main segment, "Where Love is a Scream of Anguish", focus on affection. A significant number of the sonnets in this area and the following are organized like blues and jazz music, and have widespread topics of affection and misfortune. The eighteen lyrics in the second segment, "Just Before the World Ends", center around the experience of the survival of African Americans in spite of living in a general public ruled by whites. 

Angelou utilizes the vernacular of African Americans, incongruity, modest representation of the truth, and cleverness to own her expressions about race and prejudice in America. She goes about as a representative for her race in these sonnets, in which her utilization of incongruity and cleverness enables her to represent the group and to expect a separation so as to make remarks about her subjects, points, and subjects. Commentator Kathy M. Essick have called the lyrics in "Diiie" "challenge ballads". The illustrations in her verse fill in as "coding", or litotes, for implications comprehended by different Blacks, in spite of the fact that her subjects and themes are all inclusive for most perusers to get it. 

"Simply Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" has gotten blended surveys from pundits, however was a blockbuster and was named for a Pulitzer Prize. Numerous commentators expected that the volume would be prevalent in spite of their negative audits, yet others thought of it as elegantly composed, melodious, and a moving articulation of social perception. 

"Simply Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" is Maya Angelou's first volume of verse. She considered and started composing verse at a youthful age. After her assault at eight years old, as related in her first collection of memoirs "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", she managed her injury by remembering and discussing incredible works of writing, including verse, which brought her out her deliberate muteness. 

Angelou recorded two collections of verse and tunes she composed amid her profession as a club entertainer; the first in 1957 for Liberty Records and the second "The Poetry of Maya Angelou", for GWP Records the year prior to the production of her first self-portrayal "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (1969). They were later joined into her volumes of verse, including "Diiie", which was distributed the year after "Confined Bird" turned into a smash hit. "Diiie" additionally turned into a smash hit, and was designated for a Pulitzer Prize. Notwithstanding considering herself a dramatist and artist when her editorial manager Robert Loomis provoked her to express "Confined Bird", she has been best known for her self-portrayals. A considerable lot of Angelou's perusers distinguish her as an artist first and an autobiographer second, yet like Lynn Z. Blossom, numerous pundits think of her as collections of memoirs more vital than her verse. Commentator William Sylvester concurs, and expresses that in spite of the fact that her books have been smash hits, her verse has not been seen as truly her writing. Blossom likewise trusts that Angelou's verse is all the more fascinating when she recounts them. Blossom thinks about her exhibitions dynamic, and says that Angelou "moves extravagantly, vivaciously to fortify the rhythms of the lines, the tone of the words. Her singing and moving and charging stage nearness rise above the anticipated words and expressions". 

Right off the bat in her composition profession, Angelou started exchanging the production of a collection of memoirs and a volume of verse. Her distributer, Random House, set the sonnets in "Diiie", alongside her next four volumes, in her first gathering of verse, "The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou" (1994), maybe to benefit from her ubiquity following her perusing of her ballad "On the Pulse of Morning" at President Bill Clinton's introduction in 1993. After a year, in 1995, Angelou's distributer put four additional ballads in a littler volume, entitled "Sensational Woman". 

Angelou picked "Simply Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" as the volume's title on account of her enthusiasm for oblivious honesty, which she says is "significantly lovelier than endeavoring to stay guiltless." The title is a reference to her conviction that "we as individualsÃ¢Â ... are still so guiltless that we think whether we asked our killer just before he puts the last wrench upon the throat, 'Would you please give me a cool beverage of water?' and he would do as such'". Angelou has said that on the off chance that she "didn't trust that, [she] wouldn't get up toward the beginning of the day". 

Angelou utilizes rhyme and reiteration all through the entirety of her works, yet rhyme is just found in seven of the lyrics in "Simply Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie"; faultfinder Lyman B. Hagen calls her utilization of cadence "rather conventional and bland". Passing is an essential subject all through a considerable lot of Angelou's works, particularly in "Confined Bird", which opens with it and, as indicated by researcher Liliane K. Arensberg, is settled at the book's end, when her child is conceived. Passing is legitimately referenced in 19 of the 38 sonnets in "Diiie". As per researcher Yasmin Y. DeGout, huge numbers of the sonnets in "Diiie", alongside those in Angelou's second volume "Gracious Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well", "come up short on the plain strengthening topics of her later, better known works", particularly "And Still I Rise" (1978) and "I Shall Not Be Moved" (1990). 

The subjects in the principal area of "Simply Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" center around affection. In "Southern Women Writers", Carol Neubauer states that the initial twenty lyrics in the volume "portray the entire array of affection, from the primary snapshot of energetic revelation to the principal doubt of excruciating misfortune". "Kirkus Reviews" discovers more truth in the lyrics in this area, which portray love from the point of view of a Black lady, contrasted with those in the second segment. Hagen feels that Angelou's best love lyric in "Diiie" is "The Mothering Blackness", which utilizes redundancy and scriptural suggestions to express that the Black mother adores and pardons her kids unequivocally. 

In "To a Husband", Angelou acclaims the Black slaves who helped in the advancement and development of America. She admires Black men, particularly in "A Zorro Man" and "To a Man"; she devotes "Diiie" to the subjects of the two ballads. DeGout sees "A Zorro Man" for instance of Angelou's capacity to make an interpretation of her own involvement into political talk and the "finished freedom" she puts in the entirety of her verse. The utilization of solid symbolism and conceptual imagery to portray passionate and sexual experience, yet additionally has another significance, that of freedom from agonizing and strong recollections. As indicated by DeGout, "A Zorro Man" does not have the reasonable subjects of freedom that Angelou's later lyrics, for example, "Sensational Woman" have, however its unobtrusive utilization of topics and strategies gather the freedom topic and compliment her ballads that are all the more obviously freeing. The ballad and others in "Diiie", with its emphasis on ladies' sexual and sentimental encounters, challenges the sex codes of verse written in past times. She additionally challenges the male-focused and battle ready subjects and messages found in the verse of the Black Arts development of the late 1960s and mid 1970s. Angelou's utilization of sexual symbolism, from a lady's perspective, gives new elucidations" and uncovers it from harsh appraisals". In spite of the fact that the lyric's speaker feels caught, ladies' sexuality is delineated as amazing and controls her accomplice, which moves from "the man centric presumption of male power over the sexual demonstration". Angelou's portrayal permits her perusers, for the most part ladies, to distinguish, celebrate, and universalize their sexuality to all races. DeGout states that "A Zorro Man" "enact[s] strengthening by freeing the peruser from marks of disgrace put on ladies' sexuality from sex presumptions of male (sexual) control, and from racialized thoughts of ladies' involvement". 

Bookkeeper John Alfred Avant states that a considerable lot of Angelou's ballads could be set to music like that of jazz artist and artist Nina Simone, particularly the main sonnet in this segment, "They Went Home," which he says "fits into the torchy pathetic love sack". Hagen believes Angelou's best ballads to be the ones intended to be melody verses, for example, "They Went Home". In his examination of "They Went Home", Hagen calls Angelou a pragmatist since she perceives that the wedded man who dates other ladies more often than not comes back to his better half. He states, "While the notion is mentally stable, the lines are mundane, mirroring the sad condition of the deserted". Essick, while breaking down "When I Think About Myself", expresses that the sonnet focal topic is "one's self-celebration and self-pride that keep one from losing her will notwithstanding encounters including agony and corruption". 

As indicated by Hagen, in his investigation of "No Loser, No Weeper", the speaker communicates the regular experience of misfortune, starting with immature and minor ones, for example, losing a dime, a doll, and a watch, and consummation with the loss of the speaker's sweetheart. "Kirkus Reviews" thinks about this sonnet, alongside "They Went Home", both slight and conveying "the heaviness of experience". 

The ballads in the second area of "Diiie" are progressively aggressor in tone; as indicated by commentator Lyman B. Hagen, the ballads in this area have "more nibble" and express the experience of being Black in a white-ruled world. He expresses that Angelou goes about as a representative, particularly in "To a Freedom Fighter", when she recognizes an obligation owed to those engaged with the social liberties development. As indicated by Bloom, the subjects in Angelou's verse, which will in general be comprised of short verses with solid, jazz-like rhythms, are regular in the lives of numerous American Blacks. Angelou's ballads compliment the survivors who have won notwithstanding bigotry and a lot of trouble and difficulties. Neubauer states that Angelou centers around the lives of American Black individuals from the season of subjugation to the 1960s, and that her topics "manage the agonizing anguish endured by blacks constrained into accommodation, with blame over tolerating excessively, and with challenge and fundamental survival". 

Faultfinder William Sylvester states that the representations in Angelou's verse fill in as "coding", or litotes, for implications comprehended by different Blacks. In her lyric "Sepia Fashion Show", for instance, the last lines ("I'd remind them it would be ideal if you take a gander at those knees/you got a Miss Ann's scouring") is a reference to subjection, when Black ladies needed to demonstrate their knees to demonstrate how hard they had cleaned. Sylvester states this is valid in a lot of Angelou's verse, and that it evokes an adjustment in the peruser's feelings; in this ballad, from amusingness to outrage. Sylvester says that Angelou utilizes a similar method in "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", in which modest representation of the truth contained in the rehashed expression "nothing occurs" is a litotes for the predominance of brutality in the public arena. Hagen associates this lyric with the last scene in her second personal history, "Assemble in My Name", which portrays her experience with her companion, a medication fanatic who demonstrates her the impacts of his medication propensity. As indicated by Hagen, the ballad is loaded with exasperating pictures, for example, drugs being a slave ace and the addict being attached to his propensity like a monkey joined to the road merchant's tie. 

Hagen calls Angelou's coding "meaning" and expresses, "An information of dark phonetic regionalisms and legends improves the energy about Angelou's ballads". Line six in "Harlem Hopscotch," for instance ("If you're white, OK/If you're dark colored, stay nearby/If you're dark remain back"), is a well known jingle utilized by African Americans that individuals of different societies probably won't perceive. Hagen trusts that regardless of the implying that happens in a significant number of Angelou's lyrics, the subjects and points are all sufficiently inclusive that all perusers would comprehend and welcome them. 

In "When I Think About Myself", Angelou presents the point of view of a maturing house cleaner to own an amusing expression about Blacks getting by in a world overwhelmed by whites, and in "Times-Square-Shoeshine-Competition", a Black shoeshine kid protects his costs to a white client, his words punctuated by the "pow" of his shoeshine cloth. Her lyrics, for example, "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", in this and different volumes manage general social issues from a Black point of view. African-American writing educator Priscilla R. Ramsey, while investigating the lyric "When I Think About Myself," expresses that the main individual solitary pronoun "I", which Angelou utilizes regularly, is an image that alludes to every one of her kin. Ramsey calls this "a self-characterizing capacity", in which Angelou incidentally sees the world as an outcast, bringing about the loss of her immediate and exacting relationship to the world and furnishing her with the capacity to "giggle at its attributes regardless of how politically and socially destroying". Researcher Kathy M. Essick examines a similar sonnet, calling it and a large portion of the lyrics in "Diiie", Angelou's "challenge ballads". 

As per commentator Harold Bloom, in his examination of "Times-Square", the primary line of the fourth stanza ("I ain't playing handfuls sir") is an inference to the Dozens, a diversion in which the members affront one another. The amusement is referenced in later lyrics, "The Thirteens (Black)" and "The Thirteens (White)." According to commentator Geneva Smitherman, Angelou utilizes the Thirteens, a wind on the Dozens, to analyze the affront of blacks and whites, which enables her to look at the activities of the two races. Sprout looks "On occasion Square" to Langston Hughes' blues/challenge verse. He proposes that the most ideal approach to break down the subjects, style, topics, and utilization of vernacular in this and the greater part of Angelou's ballads is to utilize "a blues-based model", since like the blues artist, Angelou utilizes chuckling or mock rather than tears to adapt to minor aggravations, misery, and extraordinary torment. Hagen looks at the subjects in "The Thirteens (Black and White)" with Angelou's sonnets "Correspondence I" and "Correspondence II", which show up in "Gracious Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well", her second volume of verse. 

Neubauer examines two sonnets in "Diiie", "Times-Squares" and "Harlem Hopscotch", that help her affirmation that for Angelou, "conditions must improve for the dark race" She states, "Both [poems] ring with a vivacious, invulnerable beat that conveys crushed considers along with in any event transitory triumph". In "Times-Squares", the shoeshiner cases to be the best at his exchange and holds his pride in spite of his embarrassing conditions. "Harlem Hopscotch" commends survival and the quality, versatility, and vitality important to achieve it. Its cadence echoes the beat of the player, and thinks about existence to a fierce match. Before the finish of the ballad, in any case, the speaker wins, both the diversion and throughout everyday life. Neubauer states, "These ballads are the artist's very own protection against the inconceivable chances in the round of life". 

Essick likewise breaks down "Times-Square", expressing that the language and musicality utilized by the sonnet's subject, particularly the redundant likeness in sound ("pow") that accentuates the finish of each line, parallels the sound of his work. The shoeshiner depends on the beat and redundancy of his melody to keep up his pace and to calm his weariness. It additionally gives an approach to enable him to boast about his capacities and gifts. The shoeshiner assumes the job of the swindler, a typical character in Black old stories, and shows his control of vernacular language, particularly when he alludes to the Dozens. 

"Simply Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" was a hit and was designated for a Pulitzer Prize. The lyrics in the volume have gotten blended surveys. Commentator John Alfred Avant perceived that the volume would be prominent because of the achievement of "Confined Bird", yet he described it as "rather very much done schlock verse, not to be mistaken with verse for individuals who read verse" and expressed, "This accumulation isn't cultivated, not using any and all means; however a few perusers are going to adore it." Martha Liddy, who looked into the gathering in a similar issue of the "Library Journal" in 1971, grouped it, as "Confined Bird", in the youthful grown-up class and called "Diiie" a "volume of gloriously melodious, rhythmical lyrics". "Kirkus Reviews" likewise found the sonnets in the volume unsophisticated yet touchy to the expressed parts of verse, for example, musicality and lingual authority, and thought of her as exposition more beautiful and intemperate than her verse. 

An analyst from "" called the ballads in "Diiie" "craftsmanlike and incredible however not extraordinary verse", and prescribed it for libraries with an accumulation of African-American writing. Faultfinder William Sylvester, who says that Angelou "has an uncanny capacity to catch the sound of a voice on a page", puts her ballads, particularly the ones in this volume, in the "foundation of dark rhythms". Chad Walsh, checking on "Diiie" in "Book World", calls Angelou's ballads "a moving mix of lyricism and unforgiving social perception". 

Of the 38 lyrics in "Simply Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie", twenty are in the initial segment, "Where Love is a Scream of Anguish," and the staying eighteen are in the second part, "Just Before the World Ends." The volume is devoted "to Amber Sam and the Zorro Man," a reference to the sonnets "A Zorro Man" and "To a Man," the two of which are in the initial segment of the book. As indicated by Liddy, "Section One contains verse of adoration, and along these lines of anguish, sharing, dread, friendship and depression. Section Two highlights verse of racial confrontationÃ¢ÂÂof challenge, outrage, and incongruity". The majority of the lyrics are short long and are freestyle. 

Section One: Where Love is a Scream of Anguish 

Section Two: Just Before the World Ends
