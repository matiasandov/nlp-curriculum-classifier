Patricia Cullen filled in as arranger, and Los Angeles performers Dean and Carol Parks chipped away at the film's six melodies. The Samuel Goldwyn Company, the US merchant for the main film, was initially set to discharge the spin-off, yet requests from the film's makers made the organization surrender. To the mortification of Goldwyn's originator, the overall circulation rights were then obtained by Columbia Pictures. 

Upon its discharge in March 1986, "A New Generation" picked up for the most part negative basic consideration; a portion of its key components got correlations with the German legend "Faust" and J. M. Barrie's "Subside Pan". The film netted just $8.5 million in North America, about 33% of what the past portion earned, and over $12 million around the world.

On board their pontoon, a yellow bear and a purple steed take care of the child creatures known as the Care Bear Cubs and Care Bear Cousin Cubs. In transit, a red ocean snake undermines themÃ¢ÂÂone of the numerous types of Dark Heart, an insidious soul. They escape by following a rainbow up to the sky, while the vessel changes into the Cloud Clipper. There, the Great Wishing Star gives the gathering their "belly images", pictures that show every animal's job or claim to fame. Genuine Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse, as the characters are named, moved toward becoming organizers of the Kingdom of Caring, a land which involves Care-a-Lot and the Forest of Feelings. 

For the Bears' first Caring Mission, True Heart and stowaway Swift Heart Rabbit (one of the Cousins) travel to Earth and visit a mid year camp for vagrants. There, they meet three of its members: a young lady named Christy, and her companions, the twins John and Dawn. A proud kid nicknamed the "Camp Champ" dependably crushes them in rivalries, and doles out them to waste obligation. Christy is unsatisfied at this; she and her companions flee, just to become mixed up in the forested areas. Genuine Heart before long discovers John and Dawn, and conveys them to the Kingdom of Caring. After they arrive, the youngsters hear a chime toll from the Caring Meter, which tells the Bears how much minding is occurring on Earth. Respectable Heart and True Heart instruct them to keep an eye on Cubs, before they leave to scan for Dark Heart and Christy. 

In the interim, in the forested areas, Christy meets Dark Heart (as a human kid) out of the blue, and requests that he make her the new Camp Champ. He concedes her that desire, disclosing to her she should pay him back with one support, and heads away while she rejoins her companions. Mindful of Dark Heart's potential, True Heart and Noble Heart move the Bear Cubs to Care-a-Lot, and the Cousin Cubs to the Forest of Feelings. The two sets rapidly grow up to turn into the Care Bear Family. 

Afterward, while the Bears set up a gathering for the Kingdom's authors, Dark Heart enters Care-a-Lot in camouflage with the goal that he can catch the entire Family. A group of Star Buddies, partners to the Bears and Great Wishing Star, drives him off; he at that point transforms into a furious red cloud. The Bears shoot light at him from their stomaches, shaping their "Care Bear Stare"; the Cousins additionally help by utilizing their "Care Cousin Call". Thereafter, True Heart and Noble Heart choose to scan for him, and leave the Bears to deal with missions without anyone else's input. 

Amid their watch, Wish Bear spots Christy stranded in a kayak inside a lake; different Bears and Cousins set out to safeguard her. Dull Heart fires lightning jolts before the group, and catches a considerable lot of them with his enchantment bagÃ¢ÂÂ the support he needed Christy to do from the beginning. The couple of Family individuals nearby confirm that she has collaborated with him. This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a gathering at the Hall of Hearts; Friend Bear, Secret Bear and Christy's companions later go along with them. 

That night, Dark Heart's impact makes different kids wreck the camp. The Bears and Cousins look for the Family individuals, before Dark Heart detains themÃ¢ÂÂfirst in confines, at that point inside enormous rubies dangling from a crystal fixture. In the mean time, John and Dawn advise Christy of their conviction to safeguard the Family from the lowlife. Feeling regretful, she at long last pays him back by conceding what she has done. In spite of this, her deal with Dark Heart is finished. 

Genuine Heart, Noble Heart, John and Dawn enter Dark Heart's nest in the midst of his approaching deed; Christy requests that he free the others. While True Heart and Noble Heart institute their Stare, lightning from his cloud strikes Christy, who shouts in dread and gets struck and injured. With little vitality left in her, she crashes down the ceiling fixture with a marble.The Family individuals, at last free from the rubies, help True Heart and Noble Heart out. 

At seeing a dead Christy, Dark Heart winds up contrite for his activities. He asks the Care Bears to breath life into her back, yet is frustrated that their graciousness isn't sufficiently even. So he, the Family, John and Dawn serenade "We give it a second thought!" enough occasions to breath life into her back. Before long, the gathering rapidly leaves the cavern as it changes into a latrine. 

Dull Heart turns into a genuine kid, and everybody is thrilled. After a dip in the lake, the campers bid a fond farewell to the Bears and Cousins; the previous Dark Heart guarantees to be a superior individual at camp. The film closes with a message from its storyteller, the Great Wishing Star, and flashbacks of the Care Bear Family's youth. 

The Care Bears establishment was made in 1981 by Those Characters from Cleveland, a division of the welcome card organization American Greetings. Right off the bat in their residency, the characters showed up as toys from the Kenner organization, and furthermore in welcome cards by Elena Kucharik. They featured in two syndicated TV specials from a Canadian movement studio, Atkinson Film-Arts of Ottawa: "The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings" (1983) and "The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine" (1984). After the specials, Toronto's Nelvana studio created the main "Care Bears Movie" in under eight months. It was dispersed in the United States by The Samuel Goldwyn Company, a free outfit, and netted US$22.9 million at the North American film industry, the biggest sum for a non-Disney energized film at the time. This achievement ensured generation of a second film, which was in thought by May 1985. Likewise with the first, creation occurred at Nelvana's offices and Taiwan's Wang Film Productions; the Canadian studio additionally enlisted South Korean faculty to deal with inking and painting. This time, more than one hundred Nelvana illustrators chipped away at the film over a seven-month duration that went on until February 1986; the organization itself got credit for the story advancement. American Greetings and Kenner dispatched Nelvana to make the continuation on contract; TV syndicator LBS Communications, a co-lender of the first, turned into the maker and moderator. 

"Care Bears Movie II" was Nelvana's third vivified highlight film, after 1983's "Shake and Rule" and "The Care Bears Movie". It denoted the directorial presentation of Dale Schott, a Nelvana staff part who filled in as partner chief on the primary "Care Bears Movie", just as the Nelvana/Lucasfilm TV arrangement "". A few different crewmembers from the main film came back to the crease; Nelvana's authors (Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith) filled in as makers, while Peter Sauder composed the screenplay and Charles Bonifacio dealt with activity obligations. Jack Chojnacki, the co-leader of American Greetings' permitting division Those Characters from Cleveland, served by and by as an official maker. A program of Toronto voice actorsÃ¢ÂÂamong them Cree Summer, Sunny Besen Thrasher, Dan Hennessey and Hadley KayÃ¢ÂÂappeared in this development. Mickey Rooney and Georgia Engel, who showed up in the main film, did not return. 

At a certain point, The Samuel Goldwyn Company was going to discharge "A New Generation", yet lost the appropriation rights in the wake of diverting down requests from the makers. In the long run, Nelvana went into exchanges with Columbia Pictures, which obtained overall showy rights in mid 1986. This drove author Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. to comment: "The way that Columbia is dispersing the Care Bears spin-off is common of the covetousness of the huge studios. Another person needs to go in and demonstrate something works, at that point a studio will charge in." By difference, Goldwyn gained the rights to the first film after major U.S. studios passed on it; they didn't see the money related potential in a motion picture pointed carefully for kids. 

As indicated by Richard Freedman of the Newhouse News Service, "This must be the principal variant of the Faust legend in which not exclusively does Faust (or Faustina [Christy], here) figure out how to renege on the settlement with the Devil, yet prevails with regards to recovering him, too." Elliot Krieger of Rhode Island's "Fortune Journal" likewise observed such a topic, featuring his survey "Faust goes to summer camp". With respect to coherence issues, an analyst in "The Scarecrow Movie Guide" watched a "montage demonstrating the Care Bears and their Cousins growing up together from early stages to full Care Bear maturationÃ¢ÂÂnullifying everything that occurred in the primary film". Mike McLane of Florida's "Gainesville Sun" gave a couple of proposals of the storyline's conceivable religious subtext. He contrasted the Great Wishing Star with God, the Bears' "excellent cloud kingdom" of Care-a-Lot to Heaven, and Dark Heart to Satan; he likewise indicated that the Bears ensured mankind like holy messengers did. 

Charles Solomon brought up that the film's peak, in which the Bears help resuscitate Christy, "borrows...flagrantly from "Subside Pan"". The "Scarecrow" giver observed this perspective, stating, "There's a horrendous scene where the Care Bears swing to the group of onlookers and argue for help as inordinate and centered minding." In his study, Hal Lipper considered it the "Tinker Bell Principle", whereupon the gathering of people must meet up to spare a diminishing character. In Vincent Canby's sentiment, the Great Wishing Star "looks like Tinker Bell in the event that she were a star-formed beanbag". 

Similarly as with the first film, Patricia Cullen formed the score for "Care Bears Movie II". The soundtrack collection was discharged in LP position by Kid Stuff Records. Los Angeles artists Dean and Carol Parks were credited as makers, essayists and entertainers of the film's six tunes, which were incorporated on the collection. Stephen Bishop, entertainer of the Oscar-designated "It Might Be You" from "Tootsie", and Debbie Allen from the TV arrangement "Popularity", were close by as vocalists. John Braden orchestrated and altered the collection. 

The Parks recorded their commitments to the venture at their home. At the season of generation, they shared their encounters of chipping away at the soundtrack: 

Paul Attanasio of "The Washington Post" gave a blended reaction to the film's music. "The tunes are dopey," he stated, "yet the score [...], which is for the most part seven sorts of jolly, has its incidental minutes." Vincent Canby wrote in his audit, "[There are] inconspicuous amplifiers [that] spill out a relentless Hit Parade of tunes to be buried by, including 'I Care for You,' 'Our Beginning' and 'Everlastingly Young.'" But Joe Fox of "The Windsor Star" prescribed it, including, "[W]henever things begin to drag a smart tune tags along to get everybody intrigued."

At this stage, it figured out how to rank over a reissue of Disney's 1959 generation "Resting Beauty", which additionally debuted that equivalent end of the week. Notwithstanding, when the last end of the week film industry results were reported "Dozing Beauty" outgrossed "Care Bears II" by $59,000. Its wide-discharge opening on March 21 acquired $2.5 million from 1,446 theaters, putting seventh on the movies graph. Throughout the following two ends of the week it earned minimal more than $1 million in twelfth spot. Amid discharge, it confronted rivalry from another toy-based film, Atlantic Releasing's "". At the time "A New Generation" opened, Richard Martin of the "Ottawa Citizen" remarked: "... The main Care Bears motion picture has turned into the best non-Disney vivified include ever. This second motion picture from Nelvana could outperform that record, since it held the consideration of everything except the most youthful individuals from the principal night gathering of people and even has something to offer grown-ups." Ultimately, this portion earned US$8,540,346 in North AmericaÃ¢ÂÂabout 33% of what the past one earned; over US$1 million of this complete originated from Canada.

The film got for the most part negative surveys, partially on account of their hypothesis that "Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation" was a piece of the establishment's promoting plan at the season of discharge. This drove "The New York Times"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Vincent Canby to start his survey by broadcasting, "Item marketing walks on." Another analyst professed to have seen pretty much every collectible inside the film's initial twenty minutes. The film was created to fill in as the establishment presentation of the Care Bear Cubs and the Care Bear Cousin Cubs, who likewise had their very own line of toys from Kenner. The plushes, estimating 11" in tallness, comprised of Bedtime Cub, Cheer Cub, Funshine Cub and Share Cub; the line of Care Bear Cousin Cubs included Li'l Bright Heart Raccoon, Li'l Proud Heart Cat and Li'l Swift Heart Rabbit.

In "The Motion Picture Guide 1987 Annual", Jay Robert Nash composed that its title "alludes to the new highlighted characters who, more than circumstantially, have wound up on the toy racks of stores all over." A commentator from the "Omaha World-Herald", nonetheless, thought that it was deluding and whined that the Cubs "are not 'another age' by any means". A few pundits considered the film a prequel to the first: the "Omaha World Herald" commentator; Edward Jones of Virginia's "The Free Lance-Star"; Charles Solomon of the "Los Angeles Times"; and Bill Cosford of "The Miami Herald".

Cost of the "Stronghold Worth Star-Telegram", ""Care Bears Movie II" is the thing that the film business calls a 'requel,' following the starting point of the Care Bear family and relatives of different species."

John Stanley communicated his perspectives in like manner in his 1988 film direct, "Retribution of the Creature Features": 

""Care Bears Movie II" is a kind of pre-continuation that, I think, requires its gatherings of people to have some earlier information of Care Bears," Vincent Canby said in his "New York Times" audit. "Young children may love this, yet anyone beyond 4 years old may discover it excessively creepy." Hal Lipper of the "St. Petersburg Times" commented that it "is a hugely captivating cartoonÃ¢ÂÂquite an accomplishment when you consider the saccharine psychobabble going for exchange". "The Miami Herald"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Bill Cosford gave it more than two stars out of four, a similar rating he had connected to its antecedent. Edward Jones remarked that "The activity can't contrast and the best of Disney. Investigate "Dozing Beauty" [...] and you'll see the distinction." Likewise, Italian faultfinder Paolo Mereghetti griped, "[This is an] revolting spin-off with ungainly activity, and not in any case the little rotisserie will think that its good times." 

Charles Solomon stated, "The new Care Bears film...is significantly more carelessly made and sells its merchandise much more indecently. [...] The movie producers appear to be more worried about exhibiting the toys than giving excitement; shared benefits clearly mean more than shared sentiments. On the off chance that somebody began selling 'Abhor Bears,' there without a doubt would be a film about them." Gene Siskel granted the film zero stars out of four (alongside "Disapproval" for "At the Movies"Ã¢ÂÂthe "Siskel and Ebert" TV show having not been presented yet), while Leonard Maltin gave it a "BOMB" rating in his "Motion picture Guide", and included: "Your children merit preferable amusement over this treacly stuff about the Kingdom of Caring. Prefab activity from the period of toy promoting tie-ins."

In 2001, the Los Angeles-based Hastings Bad Cinema Society picked "A New Generation" as one of "The 100 Worst Movies of the twentieth Century". "Notwithstanding enduring a Barney video would be desirable over sitting through this," said compiler Michael Lancaster. Presence of mind Media gave it marginally negative surveys, as the gathering reactions "Youthful preschoolers might be unnerved by this motion picture, which offers next to no in the method for learning.". The gathering likewise matured this motion picture 6+, as the subplot is unreasonably dull for the "Care Bears". 

The film got some positive surveys, be that as it may. Composing for "The Advocate" of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Norma Dyess Michaud regarded it "an unquestionable requirement see for preschoolers, particularly the individuals who are in the throes of the present Care Bear madness". Richard Martin commended the content and peak, alongside the exhibitions of the vagrant Cubs. "Their pastel, birthday-cake-and-whipped-cream world has never looked better," he expressed.
