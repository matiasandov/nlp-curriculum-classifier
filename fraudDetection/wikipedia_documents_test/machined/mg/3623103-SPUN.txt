Scout Taylor-Compton persevered through a long tryout process, however as executive Zombie clarifies, "Scout was my first decision. There was only something about her; she had a real quality. She didn't appear on-screen character y." She was one of the last individuals to be thrown for a lead job after Faerch, Mane, McDowell, Forsythe, and Harris.
