Ice square endeavor of 1959 

The ice square endeavor of 1959 () was an exposure stunt completed by the Norwegian protection material maker Glassvatt (today called Glava AS). Reacting to a test from the radio station Radio Luxembourg, Glassvatt chose to prepare a truck to bring a three-ton square of ice from Mo I Rana by the Arctic Circle, to Libreville by the Equator. There was no type of refrigeration connected, and the undertaking was proposed to show the proficiency of the protecting glass fleece utilized. The truck additionally conveyed 300Ã¢Â kg of drugs to the medical clinic of Albert Schweitzer in LambarÄÅ¡nÄÅ¡. 

The endeavor at that point was trailed by an overall press corps, and hordes of onlookers assembled in different European urban areas along the course. Intersection the Sahara, where the truck more than once stalled out in the sand, demonstrated both a perilous and difficult assignment. When the truck had endured the desert, in any case, and achieved its last goal, it was uncovered that the ice square had lost just about 11% of its unique weight. At the point when the endeavor achieved its objective it created much media consideration for the organization. It was classified "the world's most noteworthy exposure stunt". To check the 50th commemoration of the occasion in 2009, the organization made the first narrative of the endeavor accessible on the web. They likewise discharged another meeting with the undertaking's head Sivert Klevan, who was 84 years of age at the season of the meeting. 

In the fall of 1958, Radio Luxembourg propelled a test to transport three tons of ice from the Arctic Circle to the Equator. The radio station would grant 100,000Ã¢Â francs for every kilogram (at the time, US$202.55 per kilogram; $1,487.19 or Ã¢ÂÅº1,120.19 per kg in 2009 cash) that stayed at the goal; the main condition was that no type of refrigeration ought to be utilized. Overseeing executive Birger Natvik at the Norwegian protection material organization Glassvatt (today Glava AS) saw the declaration and recommended that the organization take on the test. He evaluated that by detaching the ice with glass fleece (""glassvatt"" in Norwegian) produced using fiberglass, the driver could make a few million francs. When Radio Luxembourg understood the potential misfortune, they withdrew the offer. By this point, in any case, the arranged undertaking had gotten so much consideration that Glassvatt chose to proceed with it at any rate. Among different backers were Shell, who gave the fuel, and Scania, who gave the truck. By and large, supports from eight nations financed the campaign, including Glassvatt's French mother organization, the Saint-Gobain partnership. The French patrons needed a French truck to be utilized, however the Norwegians demanded a Scandinavian one. The last position won through, and a Scania-Vabis was chosen for the assignment. The campaign's chief later conceded that a French truck most likely would have been progressively appropriate for driving in the desert. On 22 February 1959, at 9:15 am, the campaign left Mo I Rana. 

Obligation regarding the campaign was given to Sivert Klevan, a specialist with a decent sense for advertising. The ice was to be secured from the ice sheet Svartisen, and a glaciologist was conveyed along to give counsel. It before long turned out to be evident that the whole three-ton shut couldn't be brought out in one go. Rather, 200Ã¢Â kg squares were removed with a cutting tool, diverted on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town focus. There they were dissolved together to make a square of ice weighing 3,050Ã¢Â kg. The square was put in an extraordinarily built iron holder, which was protected with wood and glass fleece. The compartment was set over a truck that would convey it right to the Equator, joined by a van conveying gear and a vehicle with a film group. 

The primary stop for the endeavor was Oslo. There it was welcomed by an extraordinary service at Studenterlunden before the University. The truck was stacked with 300Ã¢Â kg of prescriptions, to the estimation of NOK 50,000. These meds were to be conveyed to the emergency clinic of compassionate Albert Schweitzer in LambarÄÅ¡nÄÅ¡, close to the last goal of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. From Oslo the campaign proceeded to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more drugs were brought along. For advertising purposes the campaign cleared its path through a few European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was gotten with function and much consideration all over. In Belgium an issue emerged over a missing traditions affirmation for the ice, however this was explained when a traditions official consented to go with the vehicles through the nation. Klevan later got an individual statement of regret for this bother, passed on by the Norwegian remote priest Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian associate and close companion. 

In Paris the campaign was escorted by police through the avenues, and the group individuals were welcome to eat with the civic chairman. From Paris the truck proceeded to Marseille. There it was lifted on board the vessel "Sidi Mabrouk", that cruised the payload to Algiers. In Algiers an extraordinary crane must be gotten to lift the truckweighing an aggregate of sixteen tons, including the iceonto the shore. The holder was depleted now to perceive the amount of the ice had dissolved. Regardless of uncommonly sweltering European climate for the season, just four liters of water had been shed. 

Intersection the Sahara was considered especially hazardous at the time as a result of guerilla powers stowing away in the mountains. The meds conveyed by the truck would have been significant plunder for these gatherings, and for the initial segment of the desert the endeavor was joined by the French Foreign Legion. The guidance the men got was "No stops, drive for your lives, regardless of whether you get a punctured tire." The intersection go without rough episodes, in any case, and more prominent issues were displayed by the components. There were no streets in the desert, and the truck was intensely stacked and not particularly adjusted to the conditions. A few times it stalled out in the desert sand; the team needed to put steel plates underneath for footing and invest hours uncovering the sand from under the wheels. This negatively affected the men, who had a constrained supply of water, in temperatures moving toward 50ÃÂ ÃÂ°C. The group burned through most evenings in desert gardens en route, yet every so often likewise dozed in camping beds in the sand. 

At a certain point the campaign met a clan of Tuaregs and welcomed them by offering their camels water from the compartment. As per the discourse in the narrative film, the camels had never tasted anything as flavorful as the Norwegian icy mass water. This was not by any means evident; the water was defiled by the glass fleece and tar paper, and it was scarcely drinkable. The endeavor touched base at the Hoggar Mountains close to the Tropic of Cancer following fourteen days of voyaging. An estimation by then demonstrated lost 96Ã¢Â litres of water. When the Sahara was crossed, after of driving, 177Ã¢Â litres had dissolved away. By and large 15Ã¢Â litres dissolved every day in the desert. 

After around three weeks, the undertaking touched base in LambarÄÅ¡nÄÅ¡ and met with Albert Schweitzer. Klevan later depicted the gathering with Schweitzer as the best snapshot of the whole undertaking. Afterward, the clinic got 500Ã¢Â kg of Norwegian klippfisk (dried and salted cod), a specific most loved with the emergency clinic's patients. The drugs were given over, and the compartment was opened. Despite the fact that the seepage had been checked all through the campaign, there was as yet extraordinary energy related with seeing the outcome firsthand. The shut of ice ended up being for the most part unblemished. 

The endeavor touched base at its last goal of Libreville on 21 March, following twenty-seven days. The square of ice was found to weigh 2,714Ã¢Â kg; it had lost just 336Ã¢Â kg en route. In spite of the fact that it was hazy how much time the undertaking would take, Klevan had at first evaluated lost 10%; the final product was around 11%. A French agent of the organization met the group in Libreville. A close companion of President Charles de Gaulle, he introduced an idea to drive the ice back to Paris. On the off chance that the team acknowledged, the President himself would have gotten the group under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, be that as it may, were excessively depleted by then to mull over such an offer. Rather, course of action were made for the vehicles to be brought back by cargo, while the team would fly home. The ice was cut up and isolated between the natives of Libreville, for whom this was an uncommon ware. Klevan, constantly aware of limited time openings, brought a bit of the ice back home with him. This ice was thusly utilized in beverages served to writers at the premiÄÂ¨re of the undertaking narrative back home in Oslo. 

The campaign had been a huge achievement, both in achieving the objective it had embarked to achieve, and by creating overall press inclusion for the organization and its item. The endeavor was accounted for on as far away as India. In 1979, Oslo Marketing Association celebrated the ice square endeavor with an uncommon occasion titled "The world's most prominent attention stunt". To honor the 50th commemoration of the occasion in 2009, Glava AS made the first narrative of the endeavor accessible on the web. They likewise discharged a recently recorded meeting with Sivert Klevan, who at that point was 84 years of age.
