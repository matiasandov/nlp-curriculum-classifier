Hadleigh Castle 

Hadleigh Castle is a destroyed stronghold in the English region of Essex, ignoring the Thames Estuary from south of the town of Hadleigh. Worked after 1215 amid the rule of Henry III by Hubert de Burgh, the stronghold was encompassed by parkland and had an imperative financial and cautious job. The stronghold was altogether extended and renovated by Edward III, who transformed it into a more terrific property, intended to protect against a potential French assault, just as to give the King a helpful private habitation near London. Based on a delicate slope of London earth, the palace has frequently been liable to subsidence; this, joined with the clearance of its stonework in the sixteenth century, has prompted it presently being demolished. The remaining parts are currently safeguarded by English Heritage and ensured under UK law as a Grade I recorded structure and booked landmark. 

Hadleigh Castle was first worked by Hubert de Burgh, the first Earl of Kent, who was a key supporter of King John. De Burgh was given the respect of Rayleigh by John in 1215 as a reward for his administrations, however decided not to build up the current "caput" of Rayleigh Castle, rather fabricating another fortress south of the town of Hadleigh. The definite date of development is questionable, yet it is currently trusted the work was directed right off the bat in de Burgh's residency of the site, consent being reflectively formally affirmed through a permit to crenellate in 1230 under Henry III. 

The site was picked over the South Essex south edge, ignoring the Thames estuary, framed from commonly delicate stores of London dirt. In the thirteenth century, marshlands would have extended away toward the south of the stronghold, with the tide every so often coming to up similar to the base of the slope itself, and the zone would have been more lush than today. By 1235 the recreation center of Hadleigh had been conformed to the palace, including forest, a fishpond, stables and a recreation center cabin, however the stronghold was additionally connected with a more extensive domain including Rayleigh, Thundersley and Eastwood Parks. 

The principal palace based on the site was likely of an octagonal plan, running along the highest point of the edge, ensured by square and semi-round wall painting towers, with a barbican guarding the eastern passageway. It most likely taken after White Castle, rebuilt by de Burgh in a similar period, or Bolingbroke and Beeston Castles, both inherent the 1220s. The stronghold was worked of Kentish ragstone and established by a mortar containing a substantial extent of seashells, especially cockleshells from the cockle beds of neighboring Canvey Island. A profitable tidal watermill had been worked by 1249, basic for making bread for the manor; later archeological work proposes that it was situated on a wharf connecting into the estuary just toward the south-east of the stronghold. Terraced gardens were worked along the south side of the chÃ¢teau neglecting the estuary, most likely including vineyards. 

De Burgh at long last dropped out of support with Henry III; he was detained and after that at long last deprived of Hadleigh Castle in 1239. For the remainder of the century, Hadleigh was held as a regal mansion, as a component of a bequest containing of agrarian land, the recreation center and the chÃ¢teau factory. By the 1250s, the manor had fallen into disregard and, notwithstanding some speculation after it was given to Queen Eleanor in 1273, it stayed in moderately poor condition. Just the factory, indispensable for the activity of the more extensive domain, seems to have been well-kept up. Another 17-meter-wide by 9-meter-long (56 foot by 30 foot) corridor and a nearby sun oriented complex were worked at the palace around 1290, however crumpled because of subsidence in no time a short time later. In 1299 the stronghold was given to Queen Margaret, who griped about the nature of the structure and demanded that fixes were completed. Her better half, Edward I, visited the chÃ¢teau twice, utilizing it as a base for chasing in the territory.

Edward remained there as often as possible amid his rule up until 1324, once in a while going to Hadleigh Castle from London on his regal scow, which docked at a wharf toward the south of the manor. 

Edward III procured Hadleigh Castle in 1330, when he recuperated it from his mom, Isabella of France, who had taken it from Edward when she removed him in 1326. Edward paid minimal starting enthusiasm to the manor, however during the 1360s chose to utilize the property, requesting substantial pieces of it to be revamped at an expense of more than ÃÅ2200.
