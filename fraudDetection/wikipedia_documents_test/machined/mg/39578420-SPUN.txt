St Peter's Church, Llanbedrgoch, is a little medieval ward church close to the town of Llanbedrgoch in Anglesey, north Wales. The most established pieces of the structure date from the fifteenth century; it was reached out in the seventeenth century and reestablished twice in the nineteenth century. The entryway is finished with carvings of two human heads, one wearing a miter. The congregation contains a perusing work area produced using fifteenth century seat closes, one cut with a mermaid holding a mirror and brush. 

The congregation is as yet utilized for love by the Church in Wales, starting at 2013, and is one of three out of a gathering of areas. It is a Grade II* recorded structure, a national assignment given to "especially essential structures of more than extraordinary intrigue", in view of its "generous medieval texture". 

St Peter's Church is in a country area along a restricted path close to the town of Llanbedrgoch in Anglesey, north Wales. The town itself is about from Llangefni, the district town. Based on raised ground inside a churchyard, access to which is through a lychgate, the congregation is committed to St Peter. The town takes its name from the congregation; the Welsh word initially signified "walled in area" and after that "congregation", and "Ã¢ÂÂbedr" is a changed type of the holy person's name, "Pedr" in Welsh. 

The date of the most punctual church on the site of St Peter's is obscure. The chancel and the nave are thought to date from the fifteenth century, and a transept was added toward the east end of the congregation most likely in the seventeenth century, to frame a cross groundplan. The congregation was reestablished twice in the nineteenth century, in 1840 and again in 1885; the 1840 reclamation was somewhat supported by a concede of ÃÅ20 from the Bangor Diocesan Church Building Society. 

St Peter's is as yet utilized for love by the Church in Wales. It is one of three houses of worship in the joined benefice of Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf with Llanbedrgoch with Pentraeth, and is inside the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. Starting at 2013, the minister is the Venerable R.ÃÂ P.ÃÂ Davies, who is likewise the Archdeacon of Bangor. 

St Peter's is worked from rubble workmanship, with substantial stones at the sides of the transepts and sandstone dressings around a portion of the gaps. The rooftop is made of slate; the stone bellcote at the west end has one chime and is finished with a cross. The nave and chancel are the most established pieces of the structure. The nave estimates 23Ã¢Â feet 6Ã¢Â inches by 14Ã¢Â feet (7.16 by 4.3Ã¢Â m); the chancel, which is isolated from the nave by a solitary advance, measures 14Ã¢Â feet 6Ã¢Â inches by 4Ã¢Â feet (4.42 by 1.2Ã¢Â m). The asylum inside the chancel is raised by a further advance and has a rail around it. The vestry is at the west end of the nave. The transepts toward the north and south of the chancel are square in plan, their sides and endsmeasuring around . The western end of the north mass of the nave has a fifteenth century pointed curve entryway set in a square edge, with beautiful examples in the stonework around the entryway and cut heads on either side of the casing; the head to one side of the casing wears a miter. An entryway in the contrary mass of the nave, likely likewise dating from the fifteenth century, was incompletely supplanted in the nineteenth century with a window. 

The window on the north mass of the nave is toward the east of the entryway, and was included the nineteenth century. It has two adjusted lights (segments of window isolated by mullions), in comparable style to the two-light seventeenth century window in the north mass of the north transept. The second window in the transept, in the east divider, is from the nineteenth century. The two windows in the south transept, in the south and east dividers, are both from the seventeenth century, and are square-headed with two lights. The window in the east mass of the chancel is from the nineteenth century and has three lights finished with stonework trefoils. It has an outer hoodmould (a beautiful stone outskirt) around the top. The glass of the considerable number of windows is designed, and some is hued; the hued glass is utilized similarly as in other Anglesey places of worship whose nineteenth century reclamations were helped by Henry Stanley, third Baron Stanley of Alderley, an Anglesey aristocrat who changed over to Islam. 

The uncovered rooftop timbers date from the nineteenth century. A large portion of the fittings date from the center of the nineteenth century, except for a perusing work area produced using two fifteenth century seat closes, one of which is cut with a mermaid holding a brush and a mirror. The work area had recently been in St Eilian's Church, Llaneilian. An overview in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire likewise noticed the octagonal textual style of questionable date, two seventeenth century commemorations inside the congregation, and a few remembrances from the seventeenth and eighteenth hundreds of years outside it. 

An overview of chapel plate inside the Bangor ward in 1906 recorded an Elizabethan silver vessel from around 1575, simply over tall, and a plain silver paten and a silver flask both dated 1904Ã¢ÂÂ05. The imprint "IL" inside a shield on the goblet presumably alludes to John Lynglay, an Elizabethan goldsmith from Chester; it was one of four cups in the see to be set apart thusly. The overview likewise noticed that the congregation never again had the pewter cup and dish recorded in the congregation terriers somewhere in the range of 1788 and 1821. 

The churchyard contains two Commonwealth war graves, of a Royal Navy mariner of World War I and an ATS officer of World War II. 

The congregation has statutory assurance from unapproved modification as it was assigned a Grade II* recorded buildingÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ the second-most astounding of the three evaluations of posting, perceiving "especially essential structures of more than extraordinary interest"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ on 12 May 1970. Cadw, the Welsh Government body in charge of the constructed legacy of Wales and the incorporation of Welsh structures on the statutory records, portrays St Peter's as "a great rustic church holding considerable medieval texture". 

Writing in 1833, preceding the nineteenth century reclamations, the savant Angharad Llwyd portrayed St Peter's as "a little lovely cruciform structure, with an attractive east window, arranged on a rough greatness, in a far off and uncovered piece of the ward". Writing in 1847, in the middle of the two rebuilding efforts, the pastor and classicist Harry Longueville Jones said that St Peter's was the main old structure in the area, and that the "inconsiderate execution" of the north entryway "won't escape take note." He said that the chancel window was of a similar plan as that in the Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan. He likewise noticed that the textual style was "abnormally put close to the passageway of the chancel". 

The Welsh legislator and church student of history Sir Stephen Glynne visited the congregation in December 1849, and saw that the transepts were "not surprisingly, cumbersome and rambling", and were "much out of extent to the short chancel and immaterial nave." He portrayed the east window as a late case of the Middle Pointed style, "of a character exceptionally visit in Anglesey."
