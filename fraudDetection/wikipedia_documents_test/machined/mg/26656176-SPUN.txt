It is the second scene of a two-section story, the principal scene being "The Hungry Earth", which includes the arrival of the reptilian humanoid Silurians. 

Proceeding from the past scene, outsider time traveler the Doctor (Matt Smith) and geologist Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) have taken the TARDIS far beneath the ground to the Silurian city where the Doctor's friend Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), a neighborhood man named Mo (Alun Raglan), and Mo's child, Elliot (Samuel Davies), are being held prisoner. In the interim, over the ground, Amy's fiancÄÅ¡, Rory (Arthur Darvill); Mo's better half, Ambrose (Nia Roberts); and Ambrose's dad, Tony (Robert Pugh), keep watch over Alaya (Neve McIntosh), a caught Silurian who is the way to liberating the prisoners. While the Doctor leaves Amy and Nasreen to arrange offering the planet to the Silurians, to enable Mo to discover his child Eliot, it is uncovered that Restac's sister Alaya has been executed by Ambrose superficially. 

Chibnall was chosen by official makers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger to compose a two-section scene about the arrival of the Silurians. Chibnall needed "Without hesitation" specifically to be about the errors individuals make under strain, and struggle that could leave ensuring a family. The scene is additionally associated with the arrangement's story circular segment, as the break known to mankind returns toward the finish of the scene. "The Hungry Earth" and "Intentionally and without hesitation" were recorded in October and November 2009, with scenes "Cold Blood" shot in Llanwynno, Wales, Cardiff's Temple of Peace, Plantasia, and a variety of areas and sets for parts of the Silurian city, which the creation group did not have any desire to resemble a cavern.

A few analysts were disillusioned by the plot and attributes of the Silurians, however the enthusiastic completion was generally commended. 

Profound under the Earth, Amy and Mo escape from Silurian specialist Malohkeh's experimentation and Mo finds his child, Elliot, calmed in a chamber and under perception. The pioneer of the Silurian warrior station, Restac, demands both the Doctor and geologist Nasreen Chaudhry be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; however Amy and Mo intrude on the preliminary with stolen weapons, they also are caught. Eldane, Restac's unrivaled, is brought in by Malohkeh and requests a stop to the threats. 

The Doctor reaches Rory; Mo's significant other, Ambrose; and Ambrose's dad, Tony, reminding them to keep their hostage Silurian, Restac's sister Alaya, alive. They are uninformed that Ambrose has just slaughtered Alaya on the grounds that she would not help Tony, whom she had tainted with Silurian venom. The Doctor organizes a gathering between Eldane, Amy, and Nasreen; the three talk about how people and Silurians can coincide superficially. Ambrose and Tony, stressed over the Silurian response when they find Alaya's demise, set Nasreen and Tony's drill to tunnel into the oxygen pockets of the Silurians' underground city fifteen minutes after they withdraw, which would obliterate it. 

In the interim, Restac has slaughtered Malohkeh for his treachery and stirred different individuals from the warrior standing, planning to arrange an upset against Eldane. The Doctor escapes with the people and channels a vitality heartbeat to the base of the drill before it impacts the city.

The break assimilates Rory's body, causing Amy to lose her memory of Rory. Coming back to the surface, the Doctor takes out the article he pulled from the break: a consumed bit of the TARDIS's sign.
