Ila (Hinduism) 

Ila () or IlÃ¤Â () is an androgyne god in Hindu folklore, known for their sex changes. As a man, he is referred to as Sudyumna and as a lady, is called IlÃ¤Â. IlÃ¤Â is viewed as the central ancestor of the Lunar tradition of Indian rulers Ã¢ÂÂ otherwise called the Ailas ("relatives of IlÃ¤Â"). 

While numerous forms of the story exist, Ila is generally depicted as a girl or child of Vaivasvata Manu and therefore the kin of Ikshvaku, the originator of the Solar Dynasty. In variants in which Ila is brought into the world female, she changes into a male structure by awesome effortlessness not long after her introduction to the world. After erroneously entering a holy woods as a grown-up, Ila is either reviled to change his/her sexual orientation consistently or reviled to turn into a lady. As a lady, IlÃ¤Â wedded Budha, the divine force of the planet Mercury and the child of the lunar god Chandra (Soma), and bore him a child called Pururavas, the dad of the Lunar administration. After the introduction of Pururavas, IlÃ¤Â is changed into a man again and fathered three children. 

In the Vedas, IlÃ¤Â is commended as IdÃ¤Â (), goddess of discourse, and depicted as mother of Pururavas. 

The story of Ila's changes is told in the Puranas just as the Indian epic lyrics, the "Ramayana" and the "Mahabharata". 

As indicated by the "Linga Purana" and the "Mahabharata", IlÃ¤Â was conceived as the oldest little girl of Vaivasvata Manu, the begetter of humankind, and his better half Shraddha. Be that as it may, the guardians wanted a child thus asked and performed severities to appease the divinities Mitra and Varuna, who changed IlÃ¤Â's sex. The kid was named Sudyumma. The "Bhagavata Purana", the "Devi-Bhagavata Purana", the "Kurma Purana", the "Harivamsa", the "Markandeya Purana" and the "Padma Purana" (alluded to as ""Bhagavata Purana" et al. writings" further) portray a variation: Ila's folks couldn't have any youngsters for quite a while and moved toward the sage Agastya for an answer. The sage played out a yajna (fire penance) committed to Mitra and Varuna to accomplish a child for the couple. Due to either a mistake in the custom, or an inability to offer the fitting penance, Mitra and Varuna rather sent a little girl to the couple. In one form, the couple supplicated the divinities, who changed IlÃ¤Â's sexual orientation. In another rendition, this change occurs after the mistaken psalms are redressed and the child is called Ila. As per a variation, Shraddha wanted for a little girl; Vashistha paid attention to her desire while playing out the penance and along these lines, a girl was conceived. Notwithstanding, Manu wanted a child so Vashistha spoke to Vishnu to change the sex of his little girl. IlÃ¤Â was renamed Sudhyumna. The records depict Ila as either the oldest or the most youthful offspring of Manu. As the offspring of Manu, Ila had nine siblings, the most prominent was Ikshvaku, the author of the Solar administration. As the child of Manu, Ila is the grandson of Surya. As per another record found in the "Vayu Purana" and the "Brahmanda Purana", IlÃ¤Â was brought into the world female and stayed female. 

In the "Ramayana", Ila is conceived as a child of Kardama, the Prajapati conceived of the god Brahma's shadow. Ila's story is told in the "Uttara Kanda" section of the Ramayana, while portraying the significance of the Ashvamedha Ã¢ÂÂ the steed penance. 

In the "Ramayana", the "Linga Purana" and the "Mahabharata", Ila develops to turn into the ruler of Bahlika. While chasing in a woodland, Ila unintentionally trespassed Sharavana ("Forest of Reeds"), the sacrosanct forest of the goddess Parvati, the associate of the god Shiva. After entering Sharavana, every single male being with the exception of Shiva, including trees and creatures, are changed into females. In the "Ramayana", even Shiva had accepted the type of a female to satisfy the goddess. One legend tells that a female "yakshini" masked herself as a deer and intentionally drove Ila to the woods so as to spare her significant other from the ruler. The "Linga Purana" and the "Mahabharata" underscore the sex change of Ila to be a conscious demonstration of Shiva to begin the Lunar line. The "Bhagavata Purana" et al. writings tell that Ila's whole company just as his pony likewise changed their sexual orientations. 

As per the "Ramayana", when Ila moved toward Shiva for help, Shiva chuckled with hatred yet the empathetic Parvati diminished the revile and permitted Ila to switch sexual orientations consistently. Notwithstanding, as a male he would not recollect his life as a female and the other way around. While IlÃ¤Â meandered the woods in her new structure with her female orderlies, Budha, the divine force of the planet Mercury and the child of the moon-god Chandra, saw her. In spite of the fact that he had been rehearsing plainness, IlÃ¤Â's magnificence made him experience passionate feelings for her at first sight. Budha transformed IlÃ¤Â's specialists into "Kimpurushas" (bisexual, lit. "is it a man?") and requested them to flee, promising that they would discover mates as IlÃ¤Â had. 

IlÃ¤Â wedded Budha and went through a whole month with him and culminated the marriage. In any case, IlÃ¤Â woke one morning as Sudyumna and remembered nothing about the previous month. Budha revealed to Ila that his entourage had been murdered in a downpour of stones and persuaded Ila to remain with him for a year. Amid every month she spent as a lady, IlÃ¤Â had great time with Budha. Amid every month as a man, Ila swung to devout ways and performed severities under the direction of Budha. In the ninth month, IlÃ¤Â brought forth Pururavas, who developed to turn into the principal lord of the Lunar administration. At that point, according to the guidance of Budha and Ila's dad Kardama, Ila satisfied Shiva with a steed penance and Shiva reestablished Ila's manliness forever. 

Another legend from the "Vishnu Purana" credits Vishnu of reestablishing IlÃ¤Â's masculinity as Sudyumma. The "Bhagavata Purana" et al. writings tell that after Pururavas' introduction to the world, the nine siblings of Ila Ã¢ÂÂ by steed penance Ã¢ÂÂ or the sage Vasistha Ã¢ÂÂ the family minister of Ila Ã¢ÂÂ satisfied Shiva to urge him to give the help of exchange month masculinity to Ila, transforming him into a "Kimpurusha". The "Linga Purana" and the "Mahabharata" record the introduction of Pururavas, yet don't portray the finish of Ila's rotating sex condition. Indeed, the "Mahabharata" portrays IlÃ¤Â to be the mother just as the dad of Pururavas. As indicated by another record found in the "Vayu Purana" and the "Brahmanda Purana", IlÃ¤Â was brought into the world female, wedded Budha, at that point was changed into a male called Sudyumna. Sudyumna was then reviled by Parvati and changed by and by into a female, yet turned into a man indeed through Shiva's shelter. 

In practically all forms of the story, Ila needs to live as a man, however in the "Skanda Purana", Ila wants to be a lady. The lord Ela (Ila) entered Parvati's woods at Sahya mountain and turned into the lady IlÃ¤Â. IlÃ¤Â wished to remain a lady and serve Parvati (Gauri) and Ganga, the goddess of the Ganges stream. Be that as it may, the goddesses prevented him. IlÃ¤Â washed in a hallowed pool and returned as Ela, whiskery and profound voiced. 

The relatives of IlÃ¤Â through Pururavas are referred to as Ailas after IlÃ¤Â or as the Lunar Dynasty (Chandravamsa) because of their drop from Budha, the child of the moon-god Chandra. Most forms of story call IlÃ¤Â the dad just as the mother of the Ailas. The "Linga Purana" and the "Mahabharata", in which Sudyumma's revile does not end, express that as a male, Sudyumma likewise bore three children named Utkala, Gaya and Vinatashva (otherwise called Haritashva and Vinata). The three children led the kingdom for their dad as Sudyumma was unfit to do as such himself due his substituting sex. The children and their realms are known as the "Saudyumna"s. Utkala, Gaya, and Vinatashva ruled Utkala nation, Gaya, and eastern locales including northern Kurus separately. With the help of the family minister Vasistha, Sudyumma recovered control of the whole kingdom. He was prevailing by Pururavas. 

In the "Matsya Purana", Ila was excluded subsequent to turning into a female or "kimpurusha". Ila's dad passed his legacy straightforwardly to Pururavas, disregarding the three children Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day Allahabad), where Ila remained with him. The "Ramayana" says that having come back to masculinity, Ila ruled Pratishtana while his child Shashabindu administered over Bahlika. The "Devi-Bhagavata Purana" tells that as a man Sudyumma administered the kingdom and as a lady remained inside. His subjects were irritated by his sex changes and did not regard him as they once had. At the point when Pururavas accomplished adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas and went to the backwoods for retribution. The sage Narada revealed to Sudyumma a nine-syllable mantra, "Navakshara", which would satisfy the Supreme Goddess. Satisfied with his starknesses, the Goddess developed before Sudyumma, who was in his female structure IlÃ¤Â. Sudyumma adulated the Goddess, who combined the lord's spirit with herself and consequently, IlÃ¤Â picked up salvation. 

The "Bhagavata Purana", the "Devi-Bhagavata Purana" and the "Linga Purana" pronounce that Ila rose to paradise with both male and female life systems. Ila is viewed as the main begetter of the Lunar Dynasty through Pururavas and of the Solar Dynasty through his sibling Iksavaku and children Utkala, Gaya, and Vinatashva. The marriage of IlÃ¤Â, a relative of the Sun, and Budha, the child of the Moon, is the main association of the sun based and lunar races recorded in the sacred texts. 

In Vedic writing, IlÃ¤Â is otherwise called IdÃ¤Â. IdÃ¤Â in the "Rigveda", connotes nourishment and refreshment, exemplified as the goddess of discourse. IlÃ¤Â-IdÃ¤Â is likewise connected with Sarasvati, the goddess of learning. IlÃ¤Â-IdÃ¤Â is referenced various occasions in the "Rigveda", generally in the songs known as "ÃÂprÃ¤Å¥sÄºÅ¥kta"s. She is frequently referenced alongside Sarasvati and Bharati (or Mahi) and Pururavas is portrayed as her child. IdÃ¤Â is the educator of Manu, in performing ceremonial penances. As indicated by Sayana Ã¢ÂÂ an analyst on the Vedas Ã¢ÂÂ she manages the Earth. 

In the "Shatapatha Brahmana", Manu played out a flame penance so as to have kids. IdÃ¤Â rose up out of the penance. She was guaranteed by Mitra-Varuna, yet she lived with Manu and together they started the race of Manu. In this content, IdÃ¤Â is the goddess of the conciliatory supper. She is portrayed as the "MÃ¤Ânavi" (little girl of Manu) and "GhÃ¡Å¡ÂtapadÃ¤Å¥" (with the ghee-dribbling foot) and she is spoken to by a dairy animals, otherwise called IdÃ¤Â amid a penance. Pururavas is referenced as the child of IlÃ¤Â in the content.
