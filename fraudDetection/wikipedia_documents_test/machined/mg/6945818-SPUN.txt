Hooper communicated his failure at this since he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their association Hooper as a rule had a further developed job, playing off the shoulder of the last protector, or in the case, and making keeps running in behind. His quality, pace, completing capacity and mindfulness made him reasonably adjusted to this job. Stirs normally assumed a more profound job, missing the mark to get this show on the road the ball and making space through his spilling expertise and passing. Despite the fact that Hooper is progressively fit to a propelled job, and Stokes to a more profound one, they were equipped for exchanging and both have the right stuff required to assume in either job. This made it difficult for protectors to stamp them. 

Amid his time as supervisor at Rangers, Ally McCoist demonstrated his players film of an objective Hooper scored against them at Celtic Park. "He makes a keep running from the midway line on the left hand side. I watched it and I demonstrated our players it", said McCoist, including that "he [Hooper] simply wants to run and run and simply jump on the finish of a cross. You can't purchase that, you can't instruct that".
