New York State Route 376 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 376 (NYÃÂ 376) is a state thruway found totally inside Dutchess County in the Hudson Valley locale of New York in the United States. The course starts at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 52 in East Fishkill and goes north through Hopewell Junction and Red Oaks Mill on its way to the city of Poughkeepsie. It closes at an intersection with U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 44 (USÃÂ 44) and NYÃÂ 55 east of as far as possible in Arlington, a village in the town of Poughkeepsie. NYÃÂ 376 was initially assigned as a feature of NYÃÂ 39 in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state thruways in New York, the East FishkillÃ¢ÂÂPoughkeepsie segment of NYÃÂ 39 was renumbered to New York State RouteÃ¢Â 202. NYÃÂ 202 was renumbered to NYÃÂ 376 in 1934 to stay away from numerical duplication with the new USÃÂ 202. 

NYÃÂ 376 starts at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 52 in the village of East Fishkill. It continues north about , traverse Fishkill Creek and proceeding into the village of Hopewell Junction, where it covers with NYÃÂ 82 for . NYÃÂ 376 leaves NYÃÂ 82 and proceeds with northwest, crossing railroad tracks and following a sharp 90Ã¢Â° S-bend with a warning pace. Before long, the course crosses another bend, however at . After this, as far as possible comes back to . NYÃÂ 376 goes by the Dogwood Knolls Country Club before gathering County RouteÃ¢Â 29 (CRÃÂ 29) in the villa of Fishkill Plains, so, all things considered NYÃÂ 376 continues west. 

Following intersection from the town of East Fishkill into the town of Wappinger, NYÃÂ 376 turns north at a crossing point with CRÃÂ 93. It proceeds with north for about through the village of Diddell, where it turns west again towards the village of New Hackensack. Here, the course meets CRÃÂ 94 and CRÃÂ 104. NYÃÂ 376 turns north at this convergence, running along the eastern border of and giving access to the traveler terminal of Dutchess County Airport. North of the airplane terminal, NYÃÂ 376 runs firmly parallel to Wappinger Creek, quickly entering the town furthest reaches of La Grange before intersection the Wappinger Creek into the town of Poughkeepsie. 

In the Poughkeepsie village of Red Oaks Mill, NYÃÂ 376 meets the eastern end of NYÃÂ 113 (Spackenkill Road) and the northern end of CRÃÂ 77 (Vassar Road) at the focal point of the network. NYÃÂ 376 approaches the convergence at a 45-degree edge, bringing about a progression of sharp traffic developments between the three roadsÃ¢ÂÂthe most honed being the 135-degree turn between NYÃÂ 376 northbound and Vassar Road southbound. Past the intersection, NYÃÂ 376 proceeds with north on New Hackensack Road, the northward continuation of Vassar Road. In the wake of traveling north and northwest for , NYÃÂ 376 takes a right hand turn onto Raymond Avenue at Vassar College. Its continuation on New Hackensack Road is known as Hooker Avenue and is assigned NYÃÂ 983T, an unsigned reference course, to the Poughkeepsie town/city line about from its intersection with Cedar Avenue (known as CRÃÂ 74 south of as far as possible). 

NYÃÂ 376 pursues Raymond Avenue for about a mile (1.6Ã¢Â km) to the villa of Arlington. Here, it meets USÃÂ 44 and NYÃÂ 55, the two of which pursue a single direction couplet along Haight Street (eastward) and Maple Street (westward) through the city of Poughkeepsie. In the middle of the two lanes, NYÃÂ 376 crosses Main Street (CRÃÂ 114). The course finishes after meeting westward USÃÂ 44 and NYÃÂ 55, so, all things considered the steering of NYÃÂ 376 turns into an unnumbered town street named Van Wagner Road. 

NYÃÂ 376 was initially assigned as a feature of NYÃÂ 39, a course reaching out from Patterson to Poughkeepsie by method for West Patterson and East Fishkill, in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state thruways in New York, NYÃÂ 39 was reassigned to another parkway in western New York while its previous steering in the Hudson Valley was separated into a few courses. One of these was NYÃÂ 202, another course that started in East Fishkill and finished in Poughkeepsie. The remainder of NYÃÂ 39 turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 52 from East Fishkill toward the western edge of Patterson, and NYÃÂ 311 for the remainder of the directing. In 1934, USÃÂ 202 was assigned by AASHO. So as to maintain a strategic distance from a numbering strife, NYÃÂ 202 was renumbered to NYÃÂ 376. 

In 2006, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) changed over NYÃÂ 376's crossing points with the fundamental door of Vassar College and College Avenue into roundabouts. Both of the roundabouts supplanted traffic lights. A traffic flag used to control traffic for a passerby crosswalk was likewise expelled as a feature of their development. Another indirect was developed in 2008 at Fulton and Collegeview Avenues. NYSDOT has considered the establishment of roundabouts a triumph, expressing that it has essentially quieted traffic, diminished blockage and expanded traffic stream. 

The development of the roundabouts was dubious from the beginning. The initial two roundabouts were introduced by NYSDOT despite the fact that both the town and city of Poughkeepsie announced that they were against the roundabouts. Also, the roundabouts have drawn much discussion from nearby occupants since they evacuate a path of traffic toward every path, diminishing Raymond Avenue (NYÃÂ 376) from a four-path street to an isolated two-path road and essentially adjusting previous traffic designs. A moderate measure of traffic has occupied onto substitute nearby courses therefore. Accordingly, NYSDOT introduced traffic quieting measures on these parallel streets before the development of the Fulton Avenue indirect.
