Sea tempest Helene (2006) 

Sea tempest Helene was the ninth typhoon, fourth tropical storm, and most grounded sea tempest of the 2006 Atlantic sea tempest season, tied with Gordon. 

Helene was an enduring Cape Verde sea tempest that framed in the extraordinary southeastern piece of the North Atlantic Ocean, cresting as a CategoryÃ¢Â 3 tropical storm on the Saffir-Simpson typhoon scale as it crossed the focal Atlantic. It never influenced land until the very end of its life expectancy as a powerless extratropical framework, which had minor effect in the northern British Isles. 

In the second seven day stretch of September, a solid tropical wave started to develop off the shoreline of Africa. It was efficient from the begin, and on September 11, even before it rose off the coast, the National Hurricane Center anticipated that it could rapidly form into a tropical melancholy. That is without a doubt what occurred, and it ended up Tropical Depression Eight on the morning of September 12. The huge size of the discouragement made it genuinely moderate to create, joined with some easterly wind shear in the eastern Atlantic and impact of the Saharan Air Layer toward the north as it followed south of the Cape Verde islands. Convection was likewise moderate to work in, with small banding at first. The underlying fortifying was postponed subsequently. In any case, on September 13, the association improved as banding turned out to be better characterized, and that night, the gloom reinforced into Tropical Storm Helene. 

The tempest gradually reinforced over the warm waters of the eastern Atlantic from that point as it followed west-northwest. Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer kept on moderating improvement on September 14 as Helene remained a low-end typhoon. Be that as it may, an episode of strengthening occurred on September 15 as shear lessened. The tempest turned out to be greatly improved sorted out with well-characterized banding, and leveled off that night at simply under sea tempest force. On the morning of September 16, the tempest started to build up a battered eye, and the tempest fortified to storm status. The power leveled off for some time as a minor Category 1 sea tempest, as the increase was hindered by the nearness of moderate breeze shear in spite of the nonappearance of huge dry air. Late that night, the tempest started to gradually escalate by and by. 

On September 17, the strengthening turned out to be increasingly fast and Helene rapidly turned into a CategoryÃ¢Â 2 typhoon that morning as the eye moved toward becoming more clear and encompassed by profound convection. Helene additionally turned all the more northward and backed off in the focal Atlantic, which was because of a shortcoming in the subtropical edge more distant north made by Gordon toward the north. The northward dismiss moved the course from any land zones. The escalation proceeded through the evening, and that night, Helene reinforced into a noteworthy tropical storm with 115Ã¢Â mph (185Ã¢Â km/h) and a base focal weight of 962Ã¢Â mbar. As shear stayed low and the seas stayed warm, Helene escalated somewhat more, cresting as a strong CategoryÃ¢Â 3 storm with 120Ã¢Â mph (195Ã¢Â km/h) twists from the get-go September 18. Around then, Helene and Gordon were at generally a similar longitude in the vast sea. Operationally, Helene was assessed to have had 125Ã¢Â mph (205Ã¢Â km/h) twists, yet the post-storm examination downsized it marginally. As Gordon moved eastbound on the evening of eighteenth, a limited edge worked in, driving Helene westbound. The eyewall crumbled to some degree, and Helene debilitated somewhat to a CategoryÃ¢Â 2 tropical storm, where it leveled off for about 48Ã¢Â hours until September 20 due to a protracted eyewall substitution cycle and a lengthened cloud design. On the twentieth, Helene swung back toward the northwest and debilitated marginally because of a slight increment in wind shear. That evening, it was minimized to a CategoryÃ¢Â 1 sea tempest, which Helene stayed until getting to be extratropical. 

At an opportune time September 21, the movement moved toward the north as it moved along the northwest fringe of the subtropical edge. That general movement proceeded for the duration of the day, notwithstanding, Helene started to turn all the more northeastward that night along the edge of the subtropical edge, east of Bermuda. A diminishing in wind shear and generally warm water around 81ÃÂ°F (27ÃÂ°C) kept the power for the most part stationary, keeping Helene as a CategoryÃ¢Â 1 sea tempest. The force held around 80Ã¢Â mph (130Ã¢Â km/h) before reinforcing somewhat late on September 22, in spite of losing some tropical qualities (it was operationally downsized to a typhoon for a concise period) as it quickened upper east in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT investigation right off the bat September 23 affirmed a top of the line CategoryÃ¢Â 1 tropical storm with 90Ã¢Â mph (145Ã¢Â km/h) winds. 

Helene progressed into a "half and half" storm with both tropical and extratropical qualities that evening, with both a profound warm center and a lopsided, frontal-like appearance. From that point forward, expanded shear debilitated Helene by and by, in spite of the fact that it remained a sea tempest quality tempest until it was completely extratropical on the morning of September 24. In the wake of getting to be extratropical, the tempest debilitated as it followed eastbound, turning into a storm focus west of Ireland at an opportune time September 27. It inevitably converged with a bigger extratropical low close to the northern end of the British Isles late on the 27th. 

While a tropical framework, Helene never moved toward land. Three boats were gotten in the external groups of Helene; the most grounded of which detailed 56Ã¢Â mph (91Ã¢Â km/h) supported breezes at an opportune time September 23 in the north Atlantic. In spite of the fact that it stayed far from the island, the storm created unpleasant waves in Bermuda. As a debilitated extratropical framework, solid breeze blasts were accounted for in Ireland and northern Scotland. The most grounded detailed breeze blast in Ireland was at the Valentia Observatory, where 56Ã¢Â mph (91Ã¢Â km/h) blasts were accounted for. In Scotland, the most grounded blast was on South Uist Island in the Outer Hebrides, where 74Ã¢Â mph (118Ã¢Â km/h) blasts were accounted for. No harm or fatalities were accounted for because of Helene.
