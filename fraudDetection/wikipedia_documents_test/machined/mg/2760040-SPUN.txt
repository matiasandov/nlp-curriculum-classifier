He revamped the primary segment of the principal melody to shape the "Crucifixus" development of the "Philosophy" in his Mass in B minor. Franz Liszt put together stretched out console structures with respect to a similar material. 

On 2 March 1714 Bach was selected concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-ruling dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he accepted primary accountability for creating new works, explicitly cantatas for the (royal residence church), on a month to month plan. is the second cantata in this arrangement, created for the third Sunday after Easter, Jubilate, after , for Palm Sunday and Annunciation, and before , for Pentecost. The recommended readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, "Submit yourselves to each statute of man" (), and from the Gospel of John, Jesus declaring his second coming in the purported Farewell Discourse, saying "your distress will be transformed into happiness" (). The content, portraying the suffering that Christians need to pass, is accepted to have been composed by Salomon Franck, the Weimar court artist who composed most messages for Bach cantatas of the Weimar time frame.

(section 19). The content of the opening melody relates to , the content of the principal recitative is taken from , "we should through much tribulation go into the kingdom of God". Franck battles this is genuine not just for the followers who were tended to legitimately, yet for each Christian. Development 4 sees the enduring of Jesus as a comfort for the distressed Christian, development 5 voices a choice to pursue Jesus even in affliction, development 6 puts forth the reassurance that it will be just a brief timeframe until all bitterness is survived, implying (as in development 4) . The cantata is shut by the 6th and last stanza of the song "" (1674) by Samuel Rodigast. The topic of the initial segment of the content is a circumstance of God's brief nonappearance. 

Bach initially played out the cantata in the Weimar court church on 22 April 1714, at that point performed it in Leipzig in his first year as on 30 April 1724. In Leipzig, "Jubilate" was the start of the exchange reasonable (Easter reasonable) which pulled in guests for three weeks. His forerunner, Johan Kuhnau, had officially noticed that "guests and recognized honorable men unquestionably need to hear something fine in the essential holy places." 

Bach revised the principal segment of the primary melody to frame the development of the in his Mass in B minor, the focal development of that work, after three decades. Franz Liszt put together two console works with respect to the primary area of development 2, "Prelude after a 'topic from Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen' by J. S. Bach" (S. 179, 1854) [for organ or piano] and "Minor departure from a subject from 'Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen' by J. S. Bach" (S. 180, 1862) [for piano].

The principal choral development, "" (Weeping, groan, stress, lose hope), is in structure. The main segment is based on an as an old-style passacaglia in 3/2 time. The lamento, a chromatic fourth ostinato, is rehashed multiple times. Musicologist Julian Mincham takes note of that Henry Purcell landed at a comparative theme in Dido's Lament in the musical show "Dido and Aeneas", which Bach most likely did not know. The initial four words are each sung by an alternate vocal part, each covering the following. Starting with the most noteworthy voice, each part sings an all-inclusive murmur. The setting is heightened, until in the seventh recurrent all voices proceed with the content all the while: "" ("fear and need" or "anguish and inconvenience"). The ninth rehash is like the first, yet in progressively extraordinary harmonies. The twelfth rehash is instrumental. The center segment of the line about the Christians "" (that bear the signs of Jesus), first stamped "un poco allegro", is in a differentiating disposition. Its last area is checked moderately slow and even, the voices enter consistently, starting with the least and rising. All through the center area, the instruments play colla parte with the voices. John Eliot Gardiner depicts the main segment as a "tombeau, a standout amongst the most noteworthy and profoundly influencing cantata developments Bach can have created to that point". 

The main recitative, "" (We should enter the Kingdom of God through much distress), is joined by the strings in a . 

In German, distress is referenced first, at that point the last Kingdom of God. Bach rehashes the starting content multiple times, while the solitary goal seems just once. The catchphrase "TrÄÅºbsal" is outlined each time by a descending line, each time with greater power. At last, a climbing scale in the main violin delineates entering the kingdom of God. The scale is in C major, while the development is in C minor, an image of the Kingdom of God which is a seen however not yet present. The scale is identified with the start of the tune of the end chorale. 

The first of three arias, "" (Cross and crown are bound together), mirrors the clashing themes of "Kreuz und Krone" (cross and crown) and "Kampf und Kleinod" (strife and gem). The aria for alto voice and an oboe which is quite often present, is in structure, ABA. A ritornello outlines section A, yet additionally goes with the vocal passage. It is in this way heard multiple times in various setting, identified with the reiterations of the passacaglia of development 2. The music outlines the association of the four differentiating components (all start with K): is sung as a melisma with a trill in measure 15, the value of the gem shows up as a trill in the voice or the backup. The content is likewise rehashed in the center segment, as Bach was all the while exploring different avenues regarding the structure. 

In the second aria, "" (I trail Christ), the choice to pursue Jesus is made. "Strolling ventures" in impersonation symbolize the accompanying. The main theme is an upward scale, showing the bearing of Heaven, played by the principal violin, imitated in quick progression continuously violin and afterward the continuo. The voice enters with a similar theme. Towards the end, the means are extended to in excess of an octave, achieving Heaven. The bass vocalist and the continuo are as one, deciphered as an otherworldly association of man and God. 

Amid the last aria, "" (Be unwavering, all torment), the trumpet plays the chorale tune "" as a ; Bach may have thought of the stanza "Weicht, ihr Trauergeister" (Go away, forlorn spirits). The type of the aria pursues the bar type of the chorale rather than the typical structure. 

The end chorale, "" (What God does, is very much done), is set for four sections, lit up by an instrumental obbligato part. Masaaki Suzuki and Gardiner utilize the trumpet that played the cantus firmus in the first aria.
