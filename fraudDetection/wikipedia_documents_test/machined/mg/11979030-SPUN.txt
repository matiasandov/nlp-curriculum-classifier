Ontario Street was not without contention on the grounds that the club obliterated its previous inside space structured by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and moved just the focal staircase to the new display space. Be that as it may, the new space is , which is bigger than the old space. 

The debut mission of the club was "to support higher guidelines of workmanship, keep up displays for that reason, and to advance the shared associate of craftsmanship sweethearts and workmanship specialists." The Arts Club of Chicago was established by craftsmen and benefactors in the wake of The Armory Show, which was on view at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1913.

Imagined as a display and social space that would develop modern discussions around a scope of media, The Arts Club has kept up its center enthusiasm for showing society "really taking shape," filling in as a key setting in Chicago for the introduction of work by the national and global cutting edge.

The club was established in 1916 and encountered its first inclusion in the "Chicago Tribune" on March 16, 1916. It had office space in the Fine Arts Building that turned out to be too restricting to even consider serving the club's main goal.

The main show included representations by Whistler, Renoir, Cassatt, Augustus John and others. By 1922, the club had outgrown its quarters and supported strengthening space at the Art Institute of Chicago until 1927 when the expense of doing as such ended up restrictive. In 1924, the club moved toward the north pinnacle of the Wrigley Building. Among its first presentations at the Wrigley building was the primary major United States appear (seventeen figures, nineteen illustrations and a composition) of BrÄËncuÄÂi.

In 1947, the club downsized its activities for a long time subsequent to losing its Wrigley Building lease. In 1951, it moved to 109 East Ontario in quarters worked to determination that were planned by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Utilizing Arts Club furniture, he planned a display, lounge area, and address lobby in a previous structure.

Feigen and Co. The Arts club did not possess the land whereupon their acclaimed Mies clubhouse was worked; rather, the club held the land in a longterm leasehold. In 1990, the proprietor of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land chose to sell. At first the Arts Club would have liked to collect the cash to buy its property alongside the 620 N. Michigan Avenue property in an exertion initiated by Richard Gray, yet it rapidly wound up obvious that the club would lose an offering war over this profitable land.

The way that the structure was so Miesian thirty years after his demise while the club concentrated on avant-gard craftsmanship was somewhat of a debate. The structure's chamber that permits sifted light into the focal exhibitions and eating territories is its essential component. Another point of convergence of the structure is the reestablished Mies van der Rohe steel staircase that gives access to the second floor. The plan incorporates white-painted steel, travertine marble, floor-to-roof blinds, dim recolored wood floors, and expansive territories of glass.
