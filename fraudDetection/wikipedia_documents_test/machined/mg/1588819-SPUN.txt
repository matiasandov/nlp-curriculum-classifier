USS "McDougal" was authorized into the United States Navy on 16 June 1914 at Boston under the impermanent direction of Lieutenant, junior evaluation, John H. Hoover; Lieutenant Commander Leigh C. Palmer expected direction on 27 July. After a squeeze journey, "McDougal" started obligation with the Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. Preceding AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs section into World War I, she worked out of New York and Newport, Rhode Island, and did moves and strategic activities along the east coast. 

Toward the beginning of April 1915, "McDougal" and destroyer were incidentally appointed to watch close to the New York Quarantine Station. There were worries by Dudley Field Malone, the neighborhood port gatherer, that a portion of the interned German steamships at New York may endeavor to slip out amid an overwhelming snowstorm. While locally available on "McDougal" amid one of these watches, Malone found what "The New York Times" named an "across the board connivance" proposed to supply British warships outside U.S. regional waters, infringing upon the American lack of bias in World War I. 

She traveled to the Caribbean and partook in armada war diversions among January and May 1916, and furthermore served irregularly with the Neutrality watch.

As indicated by a firsthand record of the occasions by Nathan Levy, an officer on "McDougal", distributed on 22 October in "The New York Times", the destroyer steamed the separation to the lightship in three-and-a-half hours, touching base after German submarine had halted the Holland America Line freight dispatch and the British traveler deliver . As Rose had finished with three different boats "U-53" had sunk prior in the day, he gave travelers and team on board "Blommersdijk" and "Stephano" satisfactory time to desert the boats. In the wake of sinking "Blommersdijk" with two torpedoes, Rose concentrated on "Stephano", flagging "McDougal" and to ask that the two destroyers move more distant away so he could sink the British ship. Six American destroyers saw "U-53" sink the liner with her deck firearm. Altogether, 226 survivors from "U-53"s five exploited people were saved by the destroyer flotilla; "McDougal" saved 6 of "Blommersdijk"s men. 

"McDougal" came back to the Caribbean for activities amid the initial three months of 1917, and after that came back to New York and Newport to plan for far off administration. 

Not long after the United States announced war on Germany on 6 April 1917, "McDougal" left for Europe as a piece of the first U.S. destroyer division sent abroad amid the war. Steaming with , the division's leader, under the order of Joseph K.

"McDougal" continued obligation along the east coast and, amid May, gave some portion of the complete adrift help as U.S. Naval force seaplanes attempted the noteworthy first aeronautical intersection of the Atlantic. Subsequent to finishing practices in the Caribbean, she was put in commission, available for later at New York on 7 August. She was laid up in decreased commission at Philadelphia and Charleston, South Carolina, in the years that pursued.

On 17 January 1920, Prohibition was organized by law in the United States. Before long, the carrying of mixed refreshments along the coastlines of the United States wound up across the board and explicit. The Treasury Department in the end discovered that the United States Coast Guard just did not have the boats to establish a fruitful watch. To adapt to the issue, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 approved the exchange from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were for possible later use and down and out. "McDougal" was actuated and obtained by the Coast Guard on 7 June 1924. Assigned "CG-6", "McDougal" was dispatched on 28 May 1925, and joined the "Rum Patrol" to help in the endeavor to uphold restriction laws.

Later that equivalent month, "McDougal" was dispatched to help the Italian steamer "Voluntas" when she had mentioned help on the 23rd, however was reviewed when "Voluntas" repealed the call for help. 

After about eight years of Coast Guard administration, "McDougal" was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 26 May 1933 and came back to the authority of the U.S. Naval force on 30 June. On 1 November 1933, she dropped the name "McDougal" to free it for another destroyer of a similar name, getting to be referred to just as "DD-54".
