IÄÂ°unn 

In Norse folklore, IÄÂ°unn is a goddess related with apples and youth. IÄÂ°unn is confirmed in the "Beautiful Edda", assembled in the thirteenth century from prior customary sources, and the "Composition Edda", written in the thirteenth century by Snorri Sturluson. In the two sources, she is portrayed as the spouse of the skaldic god Bragi, and in the "Writing Edda", likewise as an attendant of apples and granter of everlasting energy. 

The "Composition Edda" relates that Loki was once constrained by the jÄÅtunn ÄÂjazi to bait IÄÂ°unn out of Asgard and into a wood, promising her intriguing apples. ÄÂjazi, as a falcon, grabs IÄÂ°unn from the wood and takes her to his home. IÄÂ°unn's nonattendance makes the divine beings develop old and dim, and they understand that Loki is in charge of her vanishing. Loki guarantees to restore her and, as a bird of prey, discovers her alone at ÄÂjazi's home. He transforms her into a nut and returns her to Asgard. After ÄÂjazi finds that IÄÂ°unn is gone, he transforms into a hawk and irately pursues Loki. The divine beings assemble a fire in Asgard and, after an unexpected stop by Loki, ÄÂjazi's plumes burst into flames, he falls, and the divine beings slaughter him. 

Various speculations encompass IÄÂ°unn, including potential connects to richness, and her potential cause in Proto-Indo-European religion. Long the subject of craftsmanships, IÄÂ°unn is now and again referenced in current pop culture. 

The name "IÄÂ°unn" has been differently clarified as signifying "ever youthful", "rejuvenator", or "the restoring one". As the advanced English letter set comes up short on the eth (ÄÂ°) character, "IÄÂ°unn" is once in a while anglicized as Idun, Idunn or Ithun. A - an addition is at times connected to indicate gentility, bringing about structures, for example, Iduna and Idunna. 

The name "IÄÂ°unn" shows up as an individual name in a few chronicled sources and the "LandnÄÄmabÄÅk" records that it has been being used in Iceland as an individual name since the agnostic time frame (tenth century). "LandnÄÄmabÄÅk" records two occurrences of ladies by the name of "IÄÂ°unn"; IÄÂ°unn ArnardÄÅttir, the little girl of an early pilgrim, and IÄÂ°unn Molda-GnÄÅpsdÄÅttir, granddaughter of one of the soonest pioneers recorded in the book. The name "IÄÂ°unn" has been conjectured as the source of the Old English name "Idonea". nineteenth century writer Charlotte Mary Yonge composes that the deduction of "Idonea" from "Idunn" is "practically certain," taking note of that in spite of the fact that "Idonea" might be "the female of the Latin "idoneus" (fit), its nonappearance in the Romance nations might be taken as a sign that it was a unimportant classicalizing of the northern goddess of the apples of youth." 

nineteenth century researcher Jacob Grimm proposed a potential etymological association with the idisi. Grimm expresses that "with the first structure "idis" the goddess Idunn may perhaps be associated." Grimm further expresses that IÄÂ°unn may have been known with another name, and that "IÄÂ°unn would appear by Saem. 89a to be an Elvish word, however we don't know about some other name for the goddess." 

IÄÂ°unn shows up in the Poetic Edda ballad "Lokasenna" and, incorporated into some cutting edge versions of the "Beautiful Edda", in the late lyric "Hrafnagaldr ÄÂÄÂ°ins". 

IÄÂ°unn is presented as Bragi's better half in the writing prologue to the ballad "Lokasenna", where the two go to a dining experience held by ÄÂgir. In stanzas 16, 17, and 18, discourse happens among Loki and IÄÂ°unn after Loki has offended Bragi. In stanza 16, IÄÂ°unn (here anglicized as "Idunn") says: 

In this trade, Loki has blamed IÄÂ°unn for having laid down with the enemy of her sibling. In any case, neither this sibling nor executioner are represented in some other enduring source. Thereafter, the goddess Gefjon talks up and the lyric proceeds thus. 

In the sonnet "Hrafnagaldr ÄÂÄÂ°ins", extra data is given about IÄÂ°unn, however this data is generally unattested. Here, IÄÂ°unn is recognized as sliding from mythical beings, as one of "Ivaldi's senior youngsters" and as a dÄÂ­s who stays in dales. Stanza 6 peruses: 

IÄÂ°unn is presented in the Prose Edda in segment 26 of the Prose Edda book "Gylfaginning". Here, IÄÂ°unn is depicted as Bragi's significant other and manager of an "eski" (a wooden box made of slag wood and frequently utilized for conveying individual belongings) inside which she keeps apples. The apples are chomped into by the divine beings when they start to develop old and they at that point become youthful once more, which is depicted as happening up until RagnarÄÅk. Gangleri (portrayed as King Gylfi in mask) expresses that he can't help thinking that the divine beings depend enormously upon IÄÂ°unn's great confidence and care. With a chuckle, High reacts that adversity once approached, that he could educate Gangleri concerning it, yet first he should hear the names of a greater amount of the ÄÂsir, and he keeps giving data about divine beings. 

In the book "SkÄÄldskaparmÄÄl", Idunn is referenced in its first part (numbered as 55) as one of eight ÄÄsynjur (goddesses) sitting in their royal positions at a feast in Asgard for ÄÂgir. In section 56, Bragi enlightens ÄÂgir concerning IÄÂ°unn's snatching by the jÄÅtunn ÄÂjazi. Bragi says that subsequent to hitting a falcon (ÄÂjazi in camouflage) with a shaft, Loki ends up adhered to the winged animal. Loki is maneuvered further and further into the sky, his feet slamming against stones, rock, and trees. Loki feels that his arms may be hauled out from his shoulders. Loki yells and asks the hawk for a dÃ©tente, and the bird reacts that Loki would not be free except if he made a serious promise to have IÄÂ°unn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki acknowledges ÄÂjazi's conditions and comes back to his companions Odin and HÄºÂnir. At the time ÄÂjazi and Loki conceded to, Loki draws IÄÂ°unn out of Asgard into "a specific timberland", revealing to her that he had found a few apples that she would discover worth keeping, and disclosed to IÄÂ°unn that she should carry her very own apples with her so she may contrast them and the apples he has found. ÄÂjazi touches base fit as a fiddle, grabs IÄÂ°unn, takes off with her and takes her to his home, ÄÂrymheimr. 

The ÄÂsir start to develop dark and old at the vanishing of Idunn. The ÄÂsir collect at a thing where they ask each other when IÄÂ°unn had been seen last. The ÄÂsir understand that the last time that IÄÂ°unn was seen was the point at which she was running outside of Asgard with Loki, thus they have Loki captured and conveyed to the thing. Loki is undermined with death and torment. Unnerved, Loki says that if the goddess Freyja will loan him her "bird of prey shape" he will look for IÄÂ°unn in the place where there is JÄÅtunheimr. Freyja loans the bird of prey shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to JÄÅtunheimr. After one day, Loki touches base at ÄÂjazi's home. There he finds that ÄÂjazi is out adrift in a pontoon and that IÄÂ°unn is home alone. Loki transforms her into a nut, holds her in his paws, and takes off with her as quick as would be prudent. 

At the point when ÄÂjazi arrives home he finds that IÄÂ°unn is gone. ÄÂjazi gets "his falcon shape", and pursues Loki, which causes a tempest wind. The ÄÂsir see a bird of prey flying with a nut, just as the seeking after falcon, so they bring out heaps of wood shavings. The bird of prey flies over the stronghold of Asgard and drops somewhere around the divider. The hawk, be that as it may, misses the bird of prey and is unfit to stop. His quills burst into flames and the falcon falls inside the entryways of Asgard. The ÄÂsir slaughter the jÄÅtunn ÄÂjazi "and this executing is enormously famous." 

In section 10, "spouse of IÄÂ°unn" is given as a methods for alluding to Bragi. In part 86, methods for alluding to IÄÂ°unn are given: "spouse of Bragi", "guardian of the apples", and her apples "the ÄÂsir's deep rooted fix". Furthermore, in association with the tale of her kidnapping by ÄÂjazi, she might be alluded to as "ÄÂjazi's goods". A section of the tenth century sonnet "HaustlÄÅng" where the skald ÄÂjÄÅÄÂ°ÄÅlfr of Hvinir gives an extensive portrayal of a lavishly nitty gritty shield he has gotten that includes a delineation of the snatching of IÄÂ°unn. Inside the refered to segments of "HaustlÄÅng", IÄÂ°unn is alluded to as "the house cleaner who knew the ÄÂsir's deep rooted fix", "the divine beings' woman", "beer Gefn", "the ÄÂsir's young lady companion", and once by name. 

In section 33, IÄÂ°unn is refered to as one of the six ÄÄsynjur visiting ÄÂgir. IÄÂ°unn shows up a last time in the "Composition Edda" in section 75, where she shows up in a rundown of ÄÄsynjur. 

Some enduring stories with respect to IÄÂ°unn center around her childhood looking after apples. English researcher Hilda Ellis Davidson joins apples to religious practices in Germanic agnosticism. She calls attention to that cans of apples were found in the ninth century Oseberg transport entombment site in Norway and that leafy foods (IÄÂ°unn having been portrayed as being changed into a nut in "SkÄÄldskaparmÄÄl") have been found in the early graves of the Germanic people groups in England and somewhere else on the mainland of Europe which may have had an emblematic importance and furthermore that nuts are as yet a perceived image of fruitfulness in Southwest England. 

Davidson takes note of an association among apples and the Vanir, a gathering of divine beings related with ripeness in Norse folklore, refering to an example of eleven "brilliant apples" being given to charm the excellent GerÄÂ°r by SkÄÂ­rnir, who was going about as flag-bearer for the significant Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of "SkÄÂ­rnismÄÄl". In "SkÄÂ­rnismÄÄl", GerÄÂ°r makes reference to her sibling's slayer in stanza 16, which Davidson states has prompted a few proposals that GerÄÂ°r may have been associated with IÄÂ°unn as they are comparative along these lines. Davidson additionally takes note of a further association among richness and apples in Norse folklore; in part 2 of the "VÄÅlsunga adventure" when the real goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he appeals to Odin for a tyke, Frigg's ambassador (in the pretense of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits on a hill. Rerir's significant other's utilization of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the cesarean area birth of their sonÃ¢ÂÂthe legend VÄÅlsung. 

Davidson brings up the "bizarre" expression "apples of Hel" utilized in an eleventh century lyric by the skald ÄÂÄÅrbjÄÅrn BrÄÅnason. Davidson states this may suggest that the apple was thought of by the skald as the sustenance of the dead. Further, Davidson takes note of that the possibly Germanic goddess Nehalennia is some of the time portrayed with apples and parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson attests that while development of the apple in Northern Europe stretches out back to at any rate the season of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the local assortments of apple trees developing in Northern Europe are little and unpleasant. Davidson presumes that in the figure of IÄÂ°unn "we should have a diminish impression of an old image: that of the watchman goddess of the nurturing product of the other world." 

David Knipe hypothesizes IÄÂ°unn's kidnapping by Thjazi in falcon structure for instance of the Indo-European theme "of a bird who takes the divine methods for everlasting status." also, Knipe says that "a parallel to the robbery of IÄÂ°unn's apples (images of fruitfulness) has been noted in the Celtic fantasy where Brian, Iuchar, and Icharba, the children of Tuirenn, expect the appearance of birds of prey so as to take holy apples from the patio nursery of Hisberna. Here, as well, there is interest, the watchmen being female griffins." 

John Lindow guesses that the conceivable etymological significance of "IÄÂ°unn"Ã¢ÂÂ"ever young"Ã¢ÂÂwould possibly permit IÄÂ°unn to play out her capacity to give endless energy to the divine beings without her apples, and further expresses that "HaustlÄÅng" does not make reference to apples but instead alludes to IÄÂ°unn as the "lady who comprehended the everlasting existence of the ÄÂsir." Lindow further conjectures that IÄÂ°unn's kidnapping is "a standout amongst the most perilous minutes" for the divine beings, as the general development of female jÄÅtnar to the divine beings would be switched. 

As to allegations leveled towards IÄÂ°unn by Loki, Lee Hollander opines that "Lokasenna" was proposed to be amusing and that the allegations tossed by Loki in the ballad are not really to be taken as "for the most part acknowledged legend" at the time it was formed. Or maybe they are charges that are simple for Loki to make and troublesome for his objectives to discredit, or which they couldn't care less to disprove. 

In his investigation of the skaldic lyric "HaustlÄÅng", Richard North remarks that "[IÄÂ°unn] is most likely to be comprehended as a part of Freyja, a goddess whom the divine beings depend on for their childhood and magnificence [...]". 

IÄÂ°unn has been the subject of various masterful delineations. These portrayals incorporate "Idun" (statue, 1821) by H. E. Freund, "Idun" (statue, 1843) and "Idun som bortrÄÅvas av jÄÂ¤tten Tjasse I ÄÅrnhamn" (mortar statue, 1856) by C. G. QvarnstrÄÅm, "Brage sittande vid harpan, Idun stÄÄ¾ende bakom honom" (1846) by Nils BlommÄÅ¡r, "Iduns RÄÅºckkehr nach Valhalla" by C. Hansen (bringing about a 1862 woodcut demonstrated on the artwork by C. Sledge), "Bragi und Idun, Balder und Nanna" (drawing, 1882) by K. Ehrenberg, "Idun and the Apples" (1890) by J. Doyle Penrose, "Brita as Iduna" (1901) via Carl Larsson, "Loki och Idun" (1911) by John Bauer, "Idun" (watercolor, 1905) by B. E. Ward, and "Idun" (1901) by E. Doepler. 

The nineteenth century arranger Richard Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen" musical drama cycle highlights Freia, a form of the goddess Freyja joined with the IÄÂ°unn. 

Idunn Mons, a mons of the planet Venus, is named after IÄÂ°unn. The production of the United States-based Germanic neopagan bunch The Troth ("Idunna", altered by Diana L. Paxson) gets its name from that of the goddess. The Swedish magazine "Idun" was named after the goddess; she shows up with her bushel of apples on its standard.
