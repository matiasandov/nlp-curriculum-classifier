The Nike individuals were associated to the Aro individuals who framed the Aro Confederacy (1690Ã¢ÂÂ1901) which was an Igbo association that controlled slave exchanging the Enugu region. Alongside the Aro individuals who came to exchange from Arochukwu in the south were the Hausa individuals who came to exchange from the north.
