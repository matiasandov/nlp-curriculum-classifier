New York State Route 117 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 117 (NYÃÂ 117) is a state thruway in Westchester County, New York, in the United States. The southern end of the course is at a crossing point with U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 9 (USÃÂ 9) north of the town of Sleepy Hollow. The northern end is at a trade with the Saw Mill River Parkway south of Katonah, a villa in the town of Bedford. NYÃÂ 117 meets the Taconic State Parkway in Pleasantville and parallels the Saw Mill Parkway from Pleasantville to Bedford. 

NYÃÂ 117 was allocated as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state parkways in New York and initially stretched out from Tarrytown to Katonah. The TarrytownÃ¢ÂÂPleasantville bit of NYÃÂ 117 went through Kykuit, the domain of the Rockefeller family. Development on another constrained access interstate bypassing the domain toward the north started in the late 1960s and was finished in NovemberÃ¢Â 1970, at which time NYÃÂ 117 was realigned to pursue the expressway. Another roadway bypassing Katonah was worked in the mid 1990s and opened as a realignment of NYÃÂ 117. 

NYÃÂ 117 starts only north of the town of Sleepy Hollow at an exchange with USÃÂ 9 (Broadway) in the town of Mount Pleasant. The course continues commonly northeastward along Phelps Way, a four-path, separated interstate detour of Sleepy Hollow and Kykuit, the Rockefeller family's bequest. For its first , the roadway goes through a lush territory along the northern edge of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, crossing under a few of the recreation center's climbing and strolling trails. Phelps Way finishes at the northeastern tip of the recreation center, where NYÃÂ 117 crosses with the northern end of NYÃÂ 448 at Bedford Road. While NYÃÂ 448 finishes here, Bedford Road proceeds as a feature of NYÃÂ 117. 

After NYÃÂ 448, NYÃÂ 117 turns into a four-path, unified at-level road as it travels upper east through a neighborhood of Mount Pleasant. Simply past the NYÃÂ 448 intersection, NYÃÂ 117 enters adjoining trades with Saw Mill River Road (NYÃÂ 9A and NYÃÂ 100) and the northbound course of the Taconic State Parkway close Graham Hills County Park. From here, the interstate passes south of Pace University's Pleasantville grounds on its way into the town of Pleasantville, where it river to two paths and at first serves for the most part business neighborhoods. NYÃÂ 117 stays on Bedford Road for its initial couple of squares in Pleasantville; be that as it may, it veers upper east onto Manville Road only southwest of the network's focal business locale. 

As Manville Road, the interstate heads past five private squares, interfacing with the southbound bearing of the Saw Mill River Parkway before entering Pleasantville's business focus at Memorial Plaza. Inside Memorial Plaza is Metro-North Railroad's Pleasantville station, situated on the south side of NYÃÂ 117. In the wake of intersection the Metro-North tracks, the course proceeds with east along a few business hinders before swinging toward the upper east and entering another private segment of Pleasantville. The expressway in the end achieves the northern edge of the town, where it rejoins Bedford Road at an intersection with the northern end of NYÃÂ 141. NYÃÂ 117 turns north here, after Bedford Road out of Pleasantville and into the adjacent town of New Castle. 

After intersection into New Castle, NYÃÂ 117 changes names to South Bedford Road. The street removes a for the most part northeasterly track from the town line to the village of Chappaqua, a network just from the focal point of Pleasantville. NYÃÂ 117 fills in as Chappaqua's principle northÃ¢ÂÂsouth road, going by business and private neighborhoods in front of a convergence with NYÃÂ 120 (King Street) in Chappaqua's inside. NYÃÂ 120 turns north here, covering with NYÃÂ 117 for one close before separating from toward the west on Quaker Road. NYÃÂ 117 proceeds with north starting here as North Bedford Road, passing a strip shopping center before leaving Chappaqua. 

Outside of Chappaqua, NYÃÂ 117 freely parallels the Saw Mill River Parkway as it winds its path northeastward crosswise over private pieces of New Castle. The two parallel streets interface again by method for Roaring Brook Road, a four-path blood vessel found halfway among Chappaqua and the following network along NYÃÂ 117, the town of Mount Kisco. Thundering Brook Road additionally interfaces NYÃÂ 117 and the Saw Mill River Parkway to the worldwide home office of "Peruser's Digest", which contains a substantial complex limited by NYÃÂ 117 toward the east and the Metro-North tracks toward the west. From here, NYÃÂ 117 takes on a progressively articulated northeasterly arrangement that takes the course past Mount Kisco Country Club and into the town of Mount Kisco. 

Simply inside as far as possible, NYÃÂ 117 meets the north end of NYÃÂ 128 at Park Avenue. Past Park Avenue, NYÃÂ 117 proceeds with north through Mount Kisco, changing names to Main Street in front of the town's focal business locale. Here, the course enters an intersection with the western end of NYÃÂ 172 (South Bedford Road) at the fundamental access to Northern Westchester Hospital. The business environment proceed with north for another eight squares to Jeff Feigel Square, where NYÃÂ 117 associates with the east end of NYÃÂ 133. Principle Street turns northwest onto NYÃÂ 133 while NYÃÂ 117 parts toward the upper east along Bedford Road. 

As the course heads from Main Street, it continues through a concise lush, local location before entering a business region encompassing Mount Kisco Commons. A few organizations and a modern complex trail as NYÃÂ 117 proceeds with upper east through the northernmost piece of Mount Kisco and into the town of Bedford. Over the town line, the advancement along the course stays business as the street parallels the close-by railroad tracks and the Saw Mill River Parkway toward the northwest. About from Mount Kisco, NYÃÂ 117 enters the villa of Bedford Hills, where the course at first serves private neighborhoods. 

In the business focal point of the network, NYÃÂ 117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before augmenting to four paths as it crosses the railroad tracks and associates with exitÃ¢Â 39 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the following mile (1.6Ã¢Â km), NYÃÂ 117 keeps running close by the northern edge of the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another private piece of Bedford Hills as a two-path street. At Harris Road, the course turns southeastward, crossing the turnpike and the adjoining railroad tracks again as it meets with the expressway's exitÃ¢Â 42. NYÃÂ 117's southeastward keep running on Harris Road closes simply past the railroad crossing, where the expressway turns upper east onto an anonymous street prompting a business and mechanical territory south of the village of Katonah. In the wake of turning onto the interstate, NYÃÂ 117 serves different organizations before the course finishes at the southbound-just exitÃ¢Â 43 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. NYÃÂ 117 northbound feeds into the northbound course of the road, while exitÃ¢Â 43 fills in as the beginning of NYÃÂ 117 southbound. 

NYÃÂ 117 was relegated as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state interstates in New York. It at first started at the intersection of Bedford and County House Roads in Tarrytown (both piece of NYÃÂ 9A at the time) and pursued Bedford Road upper east to NYÃÂ 132 (presently NYÃÂ 35) at Jay Street in Katonah. NYÃÂ 9A was realigned to pursue Sleepy Hollow Road rather, bypassing Tarrytown totally. The previous steering of NYÃÂ 9A on Bedford Road to USÃÂ 9 turned into a short augmentation of NYÃÂ 117. The course was likewise stretched out on its northern end in the mid-1970s after NYÃÂ 35 was moved onto another roadway that skirted Katonah toward the north. 

On SeptemberÃ¢Â 1, 1980, possession and support of NYÃÂ 117 between Manville Road southwest of the Pleasantville town breaking points and Broadway inside Pleasantville was exchanged from the territory of New York to Westchester County as a feature of a thruway upkeep swap between the two dimensions of government. Consequently, possession and support of the whole of Manville Road through Pleasantville was given to the territory of New York from Westchester County. NYÃÂ 117 was rerouted to pursue Manville Road while NYÃÂ 141 was broadened one square north along NYÃÂ 117's previous steering to cross Manville Road. The rest of NYÃÂ 117's previous steering is presently County RouteÃÂ 27A (CRÃÂ 27A) from Manville Road to the Pleasantville town line, some portion of CRÃÂ 106 from View Street to Pleasantville Road, and CRÃÂ 27 from the Mount Pleasant town line to View Street and from Pleasantville Road to NYÃÂ 141. 

The segment of NYÃÂ 117's unique directing among Tarrytown and Pleasantville went through the focal point of Kykuit, the bequest of the Rockefeller family, and was intended to deal with 1,900 autos every day. The genuine volume of traffic on the roadway was a lot higher as the real normal yearly every day traffic came to upwards of 5,000 vehicles for each day. Subsequently, the Rockefeller family investigated having the course realigned as right on time as 1932. The family proposed that another parkway be worked along the northern end of the bequest. 

In 1965, Rockefeller disclosed designs for the Potantico Expressway, a connector from the to-be-built Hudson River Expressway (NYÃÂ 9A) to the Taconic State Parkway. Some resistance to the thought emerged in light of the fact that the new roadway would just profit the Rockefeller domain and not the occupants. Regardless, development started on the Potantico Expressway (presently known as Phelps Way) in 1969. At the point when the roadway was finished in NovemberÃ¢Â 1970, it turned out to be a piece of a rerouted NYÃÂ 117. NYÃÂ 117's previous arrangement along Bedford Road progressed toward becoming NYÃÂ 448. The Hudson River Expressway venture was dropped in 1971, and the western stub of the freeway presently serves Phelps Hospital. 

The easternmost bit of NYÃÂ 117 in Katonah went through a historically significant area containing a few homes going back to the late nineteenth century. Following the development of adjacent I-684 out of 1968, this fragment of NYÃÂ 117 turned into a truck course between the Interstate Highway and mechanical regions along NYÃÂ 117 south of Katonah. While the Saw Mill River Parkway would have given a backup way to go to I-684 from NYÃÂ 117, business traffic was denied from utilizing the interstate. The trucks that utilized NYÃÂ 117 would shake the notable homes as it went through the village, making little measures of harm the structures. An investigation breaking down the issue of truck traffic along NYÃÂ 117 in Katonah started in 1976 in line with the town of Bedford. 

The investigation was finished in 1978, at which time the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) presumed that traffic could never turned out to be sufficiently overwhelming along NYÃÂ 117 to realize a requirement for a detour. Be that as it may, the state kept on staying up to date with the circumstance and in the end played out a second report in 1983. In contrast to the principal ponder, this one observed traffic along the parkway to be on the ascent. Therefore, the state started making arrangements to develop a detour that would redirect truck traffic far from Katonah. Throughout the following three years, NYSDOT proposed an aggregate of nine distinctive routings for the detour. The course chosen by the town of Bedford would start at Harris Road and head north and east to the Saw Mill Parkway, which it would converge into. An exemption would then be made to permit business traffic on the road between the Katonah Bypass and I-684. The steering of the roadway, anticipated to cost $8.7 million (equal to $ in 2019), was affirmed in November 1987. 

In October 1990, NYSDOT acknowledged a low offer of $8.5 million (proportionate to $ in 2019) for the task, making room for development to start on the detour by the next month. The Katonah Bypass opened and turned out to be a piece of a realigned NYÃÂ 117. The bit of Bedford Road from Harris Road to NYÃÂ 35 is currently kept up by the town of Bedford.
