Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II) 

"Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JG 1) was a German World War II warrior unit or "wing" which utilized the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 air ship, somewhere in the range of 1940 and 1944. The name of the unit gets from "Jagd", signifying "chase" and "Geschwader", signifying "wing". First shaped in May 1939 in eastern Prussia, I./JGÃÂ 1 was one of the first gatherings made by the Luftwaffe as a major aspect of its development plans. 

Somewhere in the range of 1940 and 1942, JGÃÂ 1 worked fundamentally over the Western Front and northern involved Europe. Amid the underlying days of the war, JGÃÂ 1 confronted little opposition, aside from incidental Royal Air Force (RAF) outings. The unit was once in a while occupied with huge scale showdowns amid this time. From late 1942 onwards it was entrusted with safeguard of the Reich. After D-Day, components of JGÃÂ 1 were moved to France and were entrusted with air backing to the "Wehrmacht Heer", alongside their air safeguard job. Task Bodenplatte seriously decreased the quality of JGÃÂ 1. JGÃÂ 1 was the main unit to endeavor "flying bombarding" methods against the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) overwhelming aircraft developments. It was the main unit to be furnished with the Heinkel He 162 fly warrior. 

In 1938 the Luftwaffe visualized a five-year extension plan that used the single-engined Messerschmitt Bf 109s for short-extend local safeguard obligations and the twin-engined Messerschmitt Bf 110 for outside long-go hostile jobs. In the mid year of 1939, Luftwaffe supplanted its long haul expansionist designs for quick activation with making of five new "Geschwader" beginning in July 1939. Indeed, even those plans neglected to appear and a few gatherings ("Gruppen") were made from existing gatherings. One such gathering, I./"Jagdgeschwader" 131 (JGÃÂ 131), was in this manner made from II./"Jagdgeschwader" 132 "Richthofen" (JGÃÂ 132). The new gathering, I./JGÃÂ 131, was instructed by Major Bernhard Woldenga, and was situated in Jesau, East Prussia (current Nivenskoye in Russia). The unit was re-furnished with the Bf 109E by June 1939. 

In May 1939, the association of the Luftwaffe was changed. Accordingly, countless were re-assigned and many direction title changes occurred. I./JGÃÂ 131 was given the assignment I./JGÃÂ 1. The prominent and most senior home front wing, JGÃÂ 2 "Richthofen" had pined for that assignment, yet was left in "second spot". Be that as it may, on 7 May, just before the intrusion of France and the Low Countries, I./JGÃÂ 1 was converged with "Jagdgeschwader" 27 and re-assigned as III./"Jagdgeschwader" 27 (JGÃÂ 27). This incidentally broke up JGÃÂ 1 as a unit. After seven months, on 7 December 1940 another unit I./JGÃÂ 1 was shaped at Jever out of a few protective units dependent on the North Sea coast. 

JGÃÂ 1's job was to give air spread over a vast segment of the North Sea coastline. Its authority was "Oberstleutnant" Carl-August Schumacher. Their operational region extended from the Netherlands to Southern Norway. On 5 January 1942, Schumacher gave over order to Major Erich von Selle to progress toward becoming officer of the contender powers for "Luftflotte" 5 ("JagdfliegerfÄÅºhrer Norwegen"). 

Like its parent "Jagdgeschwader" 2, "Jagdgeschwader" 1 was assigned to be a "contributor" unit in framing another unit called "Jagdgeschwader" 11 (JGÃÂ 11) on 31 March 1943. I and II "Gruppen" JGÃÂ 1 were exchanged to JGÃÂ 11. IV "Gruppe" was re-assigned as I./JGÃÂ 1. Another III "Gruppe" was framed in Leeuwarden, Netherlands, instructed by Major Karl-Heinz Leesmann 

The new "Jagdgeschwader" 1 was moved to Deelen to ensure involved A dutch area, and "Jagdgeschwader" 11 entrusted with securing the North German fringe among Netherlands and Denmark. Erich Mix was supplanted by Major Hans Philipp as "Geschwaderkommodore". By mid 1943, JGÃÂ 1 went under the control of "Luftwaffenbefehlshaber Mitte", which proceeded to shape "Luftflotte Reich". 

For the most part, the association of JGÃÂ 1 pursued the standard Luftwaffe association for any run of the mill wing ("Geschwader"). It was instructed by a "Geschwaderkommodore", proportional to a USAAF Wing Commander or RAF Group Captain. A "Geschwaderkommodore" should have the position of Lieutenant Colonel ("Oberstleutnant") or Colonel ("Oberst"), however the position could be filled by a generally junior officer. 

At first most Luftwaffe warrior wings comprised of three gatherings ("Gruppe"), which were what could be compared to USAAF gatherings or RAF Wings. Gatherings were distinguished utilizing Roman numerals, trailed by the unit number; for example I./JGÃÂ 1. In 1942 JGÃÂ 1 was the primary unit to be extended to consolidate a fourth gathering. Mostly because of JGÃÂ 1's extension, other Luftwaffe warrior wings joined a fourth gathering from mid-1943. 

Each gathering for the most part comprised of three to four squadrons ("Staffeln"), which were recognized utilizing numbers; for example 3./JGÃÂ 1. Every squadron likewise had a subordinate home office flight ("Stabschwarm") related with it. A squadron with a foundation of 12Ã¢ÂÂ16 flying machine for the most part comprised of three to four flights ("SchwÄÂ¤rme") of four air ship normally flying in the "finger-four" development. The leader of a squadron ("StaffelkapitÄÂ¤n") generally held a position of senior lieutenant ("Oberleutnant") or chief ("Hauptmann"). The flights of a squadron were shading coded "Red","Blue","Yellow" and "Green". 

A "Geschwaderstab" was basically a Headquarters Unit ("Stabschwarm") for the whole wing. There were base camp units additionally at gruppe level. At first when JGÃÂ 1 was re-shaped in Jever, it was established as a Regional Fighter Command ("JagdfliegerfÄÅºhrer" 2) on 30 November 1939 with an expectation to co-ordinate with naval force ("Kriegsmarine") fire and flags units. This self-governing order shielding the coastline was set under "Oberstleutnant" Carl-August Schumacher. "Geschwaderstab" JGÃÂ 1 (Stab. JGÃÂ 1) was additionally on the other hand called "JGÃÂ Nord" or "JGÃÂ Schumacher" and was outfitted with Bf 109 'D' and 'E' variations. 

I./JGÃÂ 1 comprised of one Headquarters Flight ("Gruppenstab") and 1., 2. what's more, 3 "Staffels". At the point when the Battle of France started on 10 May 1940, I./JGÃÂ 1 was put under the regulatory control of JG 27. In the wake of seeing broad administration, the gathering was re-assigned III./JGÃÂ 27 on 5 July 1940. 

1./JGÃÂ 1 was transformed on 7 December 1940 in Vlissingen from the "Holland" Squadron ("Jasta" Holland). 2./JGÃÂ 1 was framed on 5 July 1941 in Katwijk, Netherlands, from the "MÄÅºnster-Loddenheide" Squadron ("Jasta MÄÅºnster-Loddenheide") of "Luftflotte" 2 while 3./JGÃÂ 1 was shaped on 1 March 1941 in De Kooy from parts of the Training/Supplement squadron of JG 52 ("ErgÄÂ¤nzungsstaffel Gruppe"/JGÃÂ 52). These three units worked autonomously until September 1941 when they were gathered into I./JGÃÂ 1 under "Major" Erich Mix. 

3./JGÃÂ 1 was requested to Sicily and later Africa, and re-assigned as 6./JG 51 on 30 November 1941. Another 3./JGÃÂ 1 was framed in Wangerooge around the same time. In January 1944, the 18 "Staffel" unit was exchanged to Dortmund where they were situated by I./JGÃÂ 1. Here they were subjected to "Major" Rudolf-Emil Schnoor, the officer of I./JGÃÂ 1. On 15 August 1944, 9./JGÃÂ 77 was exchanged to fortify I./JGÃÂ 1, getting to be 4./JGÃÂ 1. 

In September 1941, "Hauptmann" Hans von Hahn's I./"Jagdgeschwader" 3 (JGÃÂ 3) was exchanged from the Eastern Front to Germany for rest and re-supply. In November 1941, it was exchanged toward the northern Netherlands and on 15 January 1942 re-assigned II./JGÃÂ 1 in Katwijk. The gathering had been associated with the Battle of France and the Eastern Front crusades as I./JGÃÂ 3, and had 421 murders to its name by September 1941. While at Katwijk and Vlissingen, they were appointed the errand of seaside guard and insurance of transportation courses. 

In mid 1944, the Reich Air Ministry ("Reichsluftministerium"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ RLM) fortified the day-warriors of "Guard of Reich" with extra units from the Eastern Front. On 15 August 1944, II./JGÃÂ 1 was expanded to four "staffeln" with the expansion of 7./JGÃÂ 51 furnished with the Bf 109G-6 ""Gustav"" from its base at Brest-Litovsk. On landing in May 1944 at StÄÅrmede, they were re-outfitted with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and re-assigned 8./JGÃÂ 1 on 15 August 1944. 4./JGÃÂ 1 was re-assigned to 7./JGÃÂ 1. Starting here until the end in 1945, II./JGÃÂ 1 would comprise of its Headquarters Flight, "Wound" II./JGÃÂ 1, just as 5., 6., 7. what's more, 8./JGÃÂ 1. 

By January 1942, most battling wings ("Jagdgeschwader") of the Luftwaffe had made their own preparation gathering ("ErgÄÂ¤nzungsgruppe"), with which to get ready learners for operational administration with their parent wing. Each preparation bunch had its very own working squadron ("Einsatzstaffel") that served as a supplemental squadron, comprising of teachers and students. It was from such "Einsatzstaffel" that III./JGÃÂ 1 was shaped. 

III./JGÃÂ 1 was shaped in January 1942 in Husum. 7./JGÃÂ 1 comprised of supplemental flights ("Einsatz-SchwÄÂ¤rme") of military pilot schools ("Jagdfliegerschule" or "JFS") Gleiwitz, Breslau and KÄÅnigsberg. III./JGÃÂ 1 was re-assigned I./JG 11 on 1 April 1943 and another III./JGÃÂ 1 set up on 23 May in Leeuwarden driven by Major Karl-Heinz Leesmann. 

JGÃÂ 1 extended to incorporate a fourth gathering ("Gruppe") around a similar time as III./JGÃÂ 1, and was likewise framed utilizing the preparation gatherings ("ErgÄÂ¤nzungsgruppen") and preparing squadrons ("Einsatzstaffeln") of different wings. 

On 21 March 1942 IV./JG1 was re-assigned as III./JG 5. It was restored around the same time in Werneuchen with components of the past IV./JGÃÂ 1 and preparing squadrons of contender schools 1 and 4. On 1 April 1943, IV./JGÃÂ 1 was re-assigned as I./JGÃÂ 1 

At the point when JGÃÂ 1 was framed, it basically utilized the Messerschmitt Bf 109E-1. In mid-1942, II., III. what's more, IV./JGÃÂ 1 began changing over to the Fw 190; despite the fact that I./JGÃÂ 1 kept on working the Bf 109 'E' and 'F' and later 'G' models, including the particular 'F-4/Z' and 'G-1' (the last likewise being pressurized) high-elevation warrior with GM-1 help. By April 1943, I./JGÃÂ 1 had generally changed to the Fw 190A, while III./JGÃÂ 1 came back to the Bf 109G. In April 1944, III./JGÃÂ 1 was one of the main Luftwaffe units to have been outfitted with the Bf 109G-5/AS with improved supercharger and methanol-water MW-50 help. 

I. furthermore, II. JGÃÂ 1 were the main units to outfit with the Heinkel He 162A-2 "Spatz" (Sparrow, Heinkel's name for the structure), with conveyances of the He 162 in February 1945 to I./JGÃÂ 1 at Parchim. Around April 1945, II./JGÃÂ 1 moved to Rostock-Marienehe close to the Heinkel industrial facility to get the conveyances of the new air ship. 

The first I./JGÃÂ 1 situated in Jesau, had little impact in the Invasion of Poland. Inside Eastern Prussia, they were re-conveyed to three forward bases; Heiligenbeil, Schippenbeil and Arys-Rostken. I./JGÃÂ 1 had unimportant contribution and no adversary flying machine were brought down. The main loss was a pilot of 2./JGÃÂ 1 harmed by well disposed fire. On 5 September 1939, the gathering came back to Jesau. Following a ten-day stop in LÄÅºbeck-Blankensee, the gathering touched base at VÄÅrden. In spite of the fact that I./JGÃÂ 1 went under authoritative control of JGÃÂ 27, I./JGÃÂ 1 was incidentally put under managerial control of JGÃÂ 77 on 4 June 1940. It returned leveled out of JGÃÂ 27 couple of days after the fact. 

Upon landing in VÄÅrden the principal flying machine credited to I./JGÃÂ 1 was a Bristol Blenheim of No. 110 Squadron RAF shot down on a surveillance mission. In February 1940, Major Bernhard Woldenga was elevated to the situation of "Inspectorate of Fighters" and was prevailing by Joachim Schlichting. The unit proceeded to partake widely in the Battle of France. I./JGÃÂ 1 guaranteed 82 air triumphs amid the Battle of France, with "Hauptmann" Wilhelm Balthasar top scorer with 23 slaughters, and "Leutnant" Ludwig Franzisket with 9. 

Subsequent to being restored in December 1940, I./JGÃÂ 1's essential obligation was the air barrier of Germany and its Northern involved regions. In this job, the unit only worked in the Netherlands before its exchange to focal West Germany. Its principle adversaries through 1940Ã¢ÂÂ41 were accordingly solitary RAF surveillance air ship, the counter dispatching airplane of RAF Coastal Command and the medium planes of RAF Bomber Command's 2 Group, despite the fact that the gathering would see little activity contrasted with different venues amid 1941. Amid this time, this division was viewed as moderately safe contrasted with different theaters. 

Since RAF aircraft and their escorts had inadequate range to achieve German airspace, JGÃÂ 1 was fairly disconnected from the RAF's "Incline toward Europe" contender hostile of 1941 that included JG 2 and JG 26. "Oberstleutnant" Erich Mix, a veteran of World War I and more than 40 years old, guaranteed a Blenheim as his thirteenth execute in mid-1941. 

JGÃÂ 1 did anyway partake in the celebrated Channel Dash, as a component of the air spread arrangement (Operation Donnerkeil) for the German "Kriegsmarine" battlecruisers and , with cruiser on 13 February 1942. By May II./JGÃÂ 1 was relegated to Woensdrecht and Katwyk. Its first triumph was scored by "Unteroffizier" Meisner of 6./JGÃÂ 1. By mid 1942, the gathering had begun re-prepare from the prior Bf 109F-4 to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, finishing by 12 May 1942. One prominent pro from mid 1942 was "Oberfeldwebel" Gerhardt, driving scorer of JGÃÂ 1 with a count of 9 by 17 February 1942. 

From late 1942 onwards, the expanding USAAF plane hostile currently conveyed JGÃÂ 1 to the bleeding edge of the Defense of the Reich, working at high elevations against the American aircraft floods of the eighth Air Force. Outfitted with the Bf 109G "Gustav" with pressurized lodges, JGÃÂ 1 explored different avenues regarding a few official and informal methods for bringing down the substantial aircraft Ã¢ÂÂ with changing degrees of progress. One of the informal techniques Leutnant Heinz Knoke created was "air bombarding" the planes from above utilizing a postponement intertwined 250Ã¢Â kg bomb with a 15-second circuit, despite the fact that the loss of airplane execution and weakness of the bomb-conveying air ship to contenders implied the strategy was not generally received. Knoke's underlying activity utilizing air bombs was from over the aircraft development on 22 March 1943, and he announced severing the wing one of the planes, despite the fact that the main B-17 lost that day was to III./JGÃÂ 1. 

JGÃÂ 1 additionally spearheaded the utilization of underwing "Werfer-Granate" ("Wfr. Gr." or "WGr") 21 rockets as a "remain off" against plane weapon in mid-1943, despite the fact that they demonstrated unreasonably overwhelming for the warrior air ship and were expelled later in the year. 

By the beginning of 1943, JGÃÂ 1 were for the most part furnished with the Fw 190-An, aside from I./JGÃÂ 1 as yet utilizing the Bf 109G-1. The principal expansive scale air fight among JGÃÂ 1 and VIII Bomber Command happened when the last shelled the maritime base at Wilhelmshaven on 27 January 1943 with a power of 64 B-17 Flying Fortress (B-17) and 27 B-24 Liberators (B-24). Confronting them were I., II. furthermore, IV./JGÃÂ 1. With their Jever base beneath the course I./JGÃÂ 1 assaulted in full quality under "Hauptmann" GÄÅºnther Beise. In broken overcast spread, they blocked at . The absence of substantial combat hardware on the Bf 109 and the absence of experience of I./JGÃÂ 1 implied had not exactly attractive outcomes. The US groups noticed the Bf 109s did not squeeze home their assaults. Albeit the majority of the B-17s had some battle harm, just a solitary one neglected to return, with first American loss of "Guard of Reich" crusade Captain Vance Beckham's 305th Bomber Group B-17F (41-24637). There were five cases (one unverified) and the plane was shot somewhere near either "Oberleutnant" Hugo Frey of 2./JGÃÂ 1 or by "Feldwebel" Siegfried Zick of 2./JGÃÂ 1, as his second kill. Five of the Bf 109s ran down with three pilots executed, in spite of the fact that harm to the maritime base was insignificant. 

Overcast spread over the objective and awful radio correspondence implied the B-24 arrangement separated. The littler B-24 development lost their direction and crossed into the Netherlands close Woensdrecht. Subsequent to meandering over North Netherlands they turned north towards the North Sea where they jettisoned their bombs. II. furthermore, IV./JGÃÂ 1 took off from Woensdrecht and MÄÅºnchen-Gladbach to capture while 5. furthermore, 6./JGÃÂ 1 refueled at Schiphol. 4./JGÃÂ 1 made one go at the aircraft and two Liberators were guaranteed however not affirmed. 12./JGÃÂ 1 captured over Terschelling, bringing down two Liberators. Of these, one was the aftereffect of an impact with a brought down Fw 190 that cut the aircraft's tail, 12./JGÃÂ 1's solitary misfortune. 

On 4 February 1943 the night-warrior wing "Nachtjagdgeschwader 1" (NJGÃÂ 1), furnished with Bf 110 twin-engined night contenders, joined the conflict alongside I./JGÃÂ 1, II./JGÃÂ 1 and IV./JGÃÂ 1. Because of poor climate conditions just 3./JGÃÂ 1 had the capacity to discover the development at first, asserting one B-17. II./JGÃÂ 1 and IV./JGÃÂ 1 guaranteed six B-17 brought down at the expense of two contenders. 

I./JGÃÂ 1 guaranteed four B-17s and four B-24s on 26 February 1943 amid an assault on the Wilhelmshaven U-vessel yards and two Liberators were affirmed lost. One was guaranteed by "Oberleutnant" Heinz Knoke, and the other asserted by "Unteroffizier" Leo Demetz of 3./JGÃÂ 1. Thirteen B-17s were asserted brought down by JGÃÂ 1 altogether. 

On 18 March 1943, 76 B-17s and 27 B-24s were sent to assault Vegesack U-Boat Yards close Bremen. I./JGÃÂ 1, IV./JGÃÂ 1 and parts of III./JGÃÂ 1 alongside "Nachtjagdgeschwader" developments captured the planes southwest of Heligoland. Knoke and his wingman Dieter Gerhardt each assaulted one B-24 aircraft head on. Knoke's objective detonated but on the other hand was guaranteed by "Oberleutnant" Walter Borchers of 8./"Nachtjagdgeschwader" 3(NJGÃÂ 3). Gerhardt's objective B-24 limped back to England while he was shot down over the North Sea by another aircraft return discharge. The battle went on for two hours, and four B-17s and five B-24s were guaranteed shot down for the loss of two pilots and three flying machine. Just a single B-24 and one B-17 was really lost. 

On 1 April 1943, "Oberfeldwebel" Fritz Timm of 3./JGÃÂ 1 shot down a Lancaster. On 17 April 1943, "Hauptmann" Fritz Losigkeit, "Gruppenkommandeur" of I./JGÃÂ 1 shot down his first B-17, and his unit guaranteed an aggregate of three of which two were affirmed for the loss of one pilot and two Fw 190s. 17 other B-17s were guaranteed shot somewhere near JGÃÂ 1 and JGÃÂ 11. 

On 11 June 1943, Leesmann's III./JGÃÂ 11 saw activity out of the blue. The gathering blocked an arrangement of B-17s drawing nearer Wilhelmshaven. "Leutnant" Eugen Wintergerst, "StaffelkapitÄÂ¤n" of 9./JGÃÂ 1 guaranteed one B-17 for his twenty-first triumph. 

VIII Bomber Command sorted out its first substantial assault on the Ruhr Area on 22 June 1943. The primary target was the engineered elastic plant in HÄÅºls by ten B-17 gatherings. JGÃÂ 1 blocked and was credited with fifteen planes. 

On 25 June 1943, another B-17 development headed into Germany. Be that as it may, both essential and optional targets were secured with cloud and the aircraft assaulted two guards off the Frisian Islands. Somewhere in the range of eight arranged gatherings of warriors captured, among them III./JGÃÂ 1, who asserted seven planes, Leesmann in charge of one of them. III./JGÃÂ 1 lost two pilots including Adjutant "Oberleutnant" Friedrich Hardt, and three pilots were harmed. 

The climate on 25 July was poor to the point that two plane developments of VIII Bomber Command chosen their auxiliary target and a third deserted its central goal. III./JGÃÂ 1 brought down three planes, however lost Leesmann, who collided with the North Sea alongside his 37th unfortunate casualty. 

Following day, the aircraft followed elastic manufacturing plants in Hannover, alongside Hamburg U-Boat Yards. "Feldwebel" Alfred Miksch of 8./JGÃÂ 1 and "Hauptmann" Robert Olejnik of III./JGÃÂ 1 each asserted one aircraft. 

30 July 1943 was the latest day of what was named "Barrage Week". Mission No. 80 focused on the Fieseler manufacturing plant in Kassel. III./JGÃÂ 1 did mixed until the planes had shelled and were returning, and, alongside III./JGÃÂ 11, caught the aircraft close to the Dutch fringe over Emmerich am Rhein. They were out of the blue stood up to by one hundred USAAF P-47 Thunderbolts and III./JGÃÂ 1 had three Bf 109G air ship harmed, of which two were destroyed. "Leutnant" Wintergerst of 9./JGÃÂ 1 shot down one P-47, the main P-47 lost in the "Resistance of Reich" battle. The 56th Fighter Group and 78th Fighter Group recorded the loss of one warrior each. Two planes were likewise shot down. 

On 12 August 1943, 330 B-17s besieged focuses in Western Germany, escorted out of the blue by P-47s with drop tanks. II./JGÃÂ 1 had six Fw 190s power land and another six endured substantial harm, losing one pilot. 

On 8 October 1943, JGÃÂ 1 lost high scoring pro "Oberstleutnant" Hans Philipp, murdered by the P-47 contenders of the 56th Fighter Group. The "geschwaderstab" heard Philipp declare a triumph over a Thunderbolt, and his last transmission was to wingman "Oberfeldwebel" Reinhardt, expressing "Reinhardt, assault!". Reinhardt last observed Philipp's air ship vanish into a cloud. Reinhardt was injured subsequent to crashing into an adversary airplane, yet made an effective constrained landing. 

II./JGÃÂ 1 were fortified with a few "experten" as of now, including "Hauptmann" Karl-Heinz Weber (136 murders in 500+ missions with 7./JG 51) "Oberleutenant" Friedrich Krakowitzer (23 slaughters by June 1944) and Obfw. GÄÅºnther Heckmann (12 executes). It was amid late 1943 that Walter Oesau was delegated "Kommodore" of JGÃÂ 1. 

On 28 December 1943, 6./JGÃÂ 1 lost "Unteroffizier" Gerhard Hartwig and Rudolf Wezulek over Mesum and "Oberfeldwebel" Werner Essinger safeguarding over Burgsteinfurt. "Hauptmann" Hans-Georg Hackbarth, who had joined JGÃÂ 1 on 15 November was elevated to supplant Hans Ehlers in I./JGÃÂ 1, executed on 22 December 1943. 

Significant Hans-GÄÅºnther von Kornatzki had shaped an exploratory unit to assess new techniques for plane assault. "Sturmstaffel" 1 comprised completely of volunteers prepared to draw in the adversary planes in amazingly lacking elbow room, using extraordinarily equipped and up-reinforced Fw 190's (alleged "SturmbÄÅcke") or Battering Rams). These were planned to assault the aircraft from the back in tight sharpened stone arrangements, shutting to extraordinary short proximity, as swaps for the some time ago committed "ZerstÄÅrer" twin-engined overwhelming warriors, which themselves were being shot down in regularly expanding numbers by Allied escort contenders. In January 1944, the 18 "Staffel" unit was exchanged to Dortmund where they were subjected to Major Rudolf-Emil Schnoor and his I./JGÃÂ 1. 

By January 1944, II./JGÃÂ 1 was situated in Northern Germany as a "Protection of the Reich" ("Reichsverteidigung") unit under "Hauptmann" Walter HÄÅckner (62 executes). Over the accompanying couple of months II./JGÃÂ 1 now had three noted "specialists" moved in; "Hauptmann" Hermann Segatz (33 kills), "Oberleutnant" Georg-Peter Eder (33 kills) and Major Heinz BÄÂ¤r (179 kills). "Oberleutnant" Georg-Peter Eder was relegated as "StaffelkapitÄÂ¤n" of 6./JGÃÂ 1 on 15 March 1944, in the wake of recuperating from wounds endured while presenting with JG 2. 

On 4 February 1944 "Hauptmann" Hermann Segatz supplanted "Hauptmann" Walter Hoeckner as leader of II./JGÃÂ 1. Albeit Major BÄÂ¤r had driven I./JGÃÂ 77, his out spoken analysis of the Luftwaffe authority drove "Reichsmarschall" GÄÅring to downgrade him to StaffelkapitÄÂ¤n driving a task preparing gathering. He was exchanged on 21 January 1944 to 6./JGÃÂ 1 as a standard pilot. Walter Oesau invited him with confirmations to High Command that BÄÂ¤r would not have order obligations. Oesau anyway figured out how to use BÄÂ¤r's abilities as arrangement pioneer after the demise of Segatz on 8 March 1944, and BÄÂ¤r was delegated as acting authority of II./JGÃÂ 1. 

On 24 February 1944, the Eighth Air Force endeavored to rehash the accomplishment of 20 February. first and second Divisions flew due east towards Germany and the third Division east-upper east without escort. In the wake of intersection into Schleswig-Holstein they assaulted focuses along the Baltic ocean coast. The first and second Divisions were viewed as the primary purpose of the assault and the third Division went left alone. The B-24 aircraft of the second Division were booked to bomb Gotha and JGÃÂ 1 were coordinated to assault these B-24s. Because of solid tailwinds and flying at lower elevation, the aircraft were isolated from their escorting contenders and JGÃÂ 1 came to Gotha before the planes. Significant Heinz BÄÂ¤r drove II./JGÃÂ 1 in a plunging assault and asserted four B-24s while I./JGÃÂ 1 assaulted head-on and guaranteed five B-24s brought down. 

At the time a "get together order" set up managed that the senior pilot arriving at any contender runway would expect direction of all other military pilots (regardless of unit) arriving on that landing strip with a workable air ship. This empowered substantial impromptu arrangements of contenders to be rapidly tossed once more into the fight. JGÃÂ 1's Walter Oesau drove one such assault with ad libbed direction. 

On 6 March 1944, Jimmy Doolittle requested 730 planes to bomb Berlin out of the blue. They were escorted by 644 contenders from eighth Air Force, ninth Air Force and the RAF. The Commander of I. "Jagdkorps" mentioned and got fortifications from II. "Jagdkorps" and 7 Jagd-Division. Oesau drove Stab./JGÃÂ 1 and I./JGÃÂ 1, Major BÄÂ¤r drove II./JGÃÂ 1, and joined by I./JGÃÂ 11 and III./JG 54 they at first captured sixteen B-17s of 100th Bomb Group who were escorted by P-47s of the 78th Group. Ten B-17s went down in the main wave, and in a few floods of assaults on the planes from various bearings the majority of the pilots wound up depleting their ammo, bringing about twenty aircraft being shot down in the 25 minutes before the escorting P-47s arrived. 

Amid the principal half of 1944, Allied assaults on railroad systems had altogether disappointed "Reichsmarschall" Hermann GÄÅring. GÄÅring was not in any way content with the failure to stop Allied tasks over Germany, and he scrutinized the responsibility of a few warrior wing pioneers who were not flying and specifically driving their units all the time. On 11 May 1944, 1,000 B-17 and B-24 planes of the eighth Air Force assaulted indispensable railroad arranges in north east Belgium and eastern France, escorted by a much more noteworthy number of warriors. Oesau was wiped out and in bed at the time in any case, incensed by GÄÅring's hints, took off with two different warriors of the Headquarters Flight in his "Green 12" Bf 109. 

There are different adaptations with respect to his demise. One variant proposed that his wingman detailed harm and was approached to sever. Alone over the Ardennes, he was locked in by no less than four escorting P-38s or potentially by P-51s. In the following 20 minute dogfight, he was killed slamming close St. Vith. In his memory, "Jagdgeschwader" 1 was conceded the "Oesau" postfix.

The wing had served solely in North Germany and the Netherlands as of not long ago, when it was exchanged to Central and Western Germany before moving to France, giving air spread over the Army ("Wehrmacht") amid the Battle of Normandy. 

On D-Day, II./JGÃÂ 1 got requests to exchange west from their base close StÄÅrmede. 32 Fw 190A-8s took off under the direction of "Oberleutnant" Eder, and set out toward Essay. By late evening all the flying machine arrived at Montdidier. News that their unique goal had been besieged implied a preoccupation to Le Mans. The recently included "Staffel" 7./JGÃÂ 51 (later 8./JGÃÂ 1) was assaulted by Mustangs close Le Mans, Lt. Johann BrÄÅºnnler being shot down and murdered. I./JGÃÂ 1 and II./JGÃÂ 1, alongside II./JGÃÂ 53, were based at Le Mans with a supplement of 100 Fw 190s and Bf 109s. 

The following day saw the outstanding loss of "Hauptmann" Karl-Heinz Weber, officer of III./JGÃÂ 1 who was shot down and killed by Mustangs. It was from Le Mans that JGÃÂ 1 began to perform warrior aircraft ("Jagdbomber" or "Jabo") missions, despite the fact that I. nor II./JGÃÂ 1 had any specific preparing. On 8 June 1944 both "gruppen" were sent off on ground-assault missions. 25 Fw 190s of II./JGÃÂ 1 assaulted Allied sending off the Normandy coast left alone. RAF airplane bombarded Le Mans landing strip the evening of 9 June, bringing about II./JGÃÂ 1 losing seven flying machine and five harmed. "Oberleutnant" RÄÅºdiger von Kirchmayr flew back to 4./JGÃÂ 1 after hospitalization on 12 June in StÄÅrmede, and in transit he was assaulted by Spitfires over Flers, asserting an unsubstantiated murder subsequently. There was a subsequent shelling assault on 15 June bringing about lost two more Fw 190s. 

On 15 June 1944, "Feldwebel" GÄÅºnther Henschel of 8./JGÃÂ 1 brought down a Mustang north of Caen. One Fw 190 was brought down without human misfortune.

Friedrich Krakowitzer (24th execute) and "Oberfeldwebel" GÄÅºnther Heckmann (thirteenth murder). The base at Essay was bombarded that day by B-24 Liberators, making the runway unacceptable for missions. 

This incited an exchange to an arrival ground at SemallÄÅ¡, south-east of AlenÄÂ§on. As the unit was setting up itself here, they went under new assault from Mustangs, which shot up the landing strip, pulverizing 15 Fw 190s and putting II./JGÃÂ 1 out of the fight. Around 11 non-operational Fw 190s were additionally destroyedÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ bringing about the last misfortunes of II./JGÃÂ 1 in Normandy.

In poor flying conditions, a large number of the new unpracticed pilots of I./JGÃÂ 1 were lost, about 20 airplane being shot down. I./JGÃÂ 1 was then relegated to help arrangements for the Ardennes counter-hostile, which would restart the Battle of the Bulge 

Giving air backing to the military in the Bastogne territory was as hard for II./JGÃÂ 1, losing a few experienced pilots. On 26 December 1944,"Leutnant" Horst Ertmann, "Oberfeldwebel" Georg Hutter and "Oberfeldwebel" Reinhard Flecks of 5./JGÃÂ 11 and 6./JGÃÂ 11 were altogether lost.

In late 1944, the Luftwaffe Operation "Bodenplatte" with the point of devastating Allied strategic flying corps situated in the Low Countries, and subsequently restoring the hindered advancement of the "Wehrmacht" amid the Battle of the Bulge. The task was propelled on New Year's Day, 1945. JGÃÂ 1 took part in this activity with requests to wreck however many adversary airplane on the ground as could reasonably be expected. In spite of the fact that countless air ship were annihilated, the Luftwaffe lost an expansive number of pilots that were essential. 

JGÃÂ 1's objectives included: 

JGÃÂ 1 lost ten pilots slaughtered, seven absent and eight caught. 

Amid a battle with No. 308 Squadron Spitfires, by Flight Sergeant JÄÅzef Stanowski drew in "Hauptmann" Georg Hackbarth (30 slaughters) and his Fw 190A-8 slammed close St. Pieters railroad station, his body being tossed clear of the destruction. "Fw." Karl Hahn was additionally shot somewhere near Stanowski, as might have been "Feldwebel" Harry Klints' I./JGÃÂ 1 Fw 190 "Green 5" which slammed close Zwijnaarde. Flying Officer Tadeusz Szlenkier additionally guaranteed the Fw 190 steered by Klints. Szlenkier thus was assaulted and crash-landed. 

In any case, Stanowski needed to crash-land because of absence of fuel. As No. 308 Squadron came back to base they shot down four a greater amount of the I./JGÃÂ 1 warriors. 

It was then that II./JGÃÂ 1 arrived. "Fw." Edger Ardner of 5./JGÃÂ 1 was locked in by two Spitfires and shot down, rescuing and taken prisoner. No. 317 Squadron at that point joined the "mÄÅlÄÅ¡e" upon entry. Warrant Officer StanisÄºÂaw Piesik shot down another Fw 190. 

One onlooker account proposed a portion of the brought down JGÃÂ 1 pilots confronted the fury of Belgium regular folks, refering to that the group of one of the pilots was stripped and assaulted by a furious crowd. Another pilot, "Unteroffizier" Fritz Hoffman, scarcely gotten away by surrendering to Allied powers in the wake of being shot somewhere near Flight Lieutenant CzesÄºÂaw Mroczyk of 317 Squadron.

Another Allied pilot crash-arrived subsequent to bringing down a German air ship. 

Pilot Officer Andrzej Dromlewicz was credited for bringing down another German flying machine and Flight Lieutenant Mach shot down another German air ship after a pursuit at ground level. Another German Fw 190 was shot somewhere near his wing man, Warrant Officer StanisÄºÂaw Bednarczyk. 

The rest of the pilots of I./JGÃÂ 1 and II./JGÃÂ 1 began their back home adventure, some of whom, as "Fw." Paul Wunderlich, were brought down by adversary fire. They likewise experienced harsh criticism from agreeable fire, bringing down much more pilots. 

Altogether, JGÃÂ 1 asserted 32 Spitfires, one B-17 and one Short Stirling on the ground. Be that as it may, RAF records state just 13 Spitfires were decimated, with 8 shot down in ethereal battle. Only 4 were recorded as lost in flying commitment with JGÃÂ 1. 

After the terrible misfortunes of Operation "Bodenplatte", and neglecting to keep up air predominance over the Ardennes region, a seriously debilitated II./JGÃÂ 1 moved to Insterburg in East Prussia (present day Chernyakhovsk in Russia). I./JGÃÂ 1 confronted British contenders over Hengelo-Twente on 14 January 1945. JGÃÂ 1 lost 12 pilots with 7 being executed, 3 injured and 2 missing. Firecrackers shot down the whole 1. what's more, 2. staffels of JGÃÂ 1 at Twente airplane terminal as they took off (for the loss of two). Ihlefeld took steps to court military Major G. Capito, the new pioneer of I./JGÃÂ 1, for such a shocking misfortune however was unfit to amid the exchanging toward the Eastern Front. In Poland JGÃÂ 1 were quickly allocated to "Luftflotte Reich" (the Air Fleet doled out to protect what was left of Germany from the last Allied offensives). 

It was amid this time the unit started changing over to the new fly moved Heinkel He 162A "Spatz" (sparrow), the triumphant structure in the Luftwaffe's ""VolksjÄÂ¤ger"" crisis stream warrior plan rivalry held amid 1944. I./JGÃÂ 1 began preparing on the new fly flying machine in March 1945. Somewhere in the range of 12 pilots were slaughtered in mishaps flying the new contender. I./JGÃÂ 1 had moved back to Parchim, performing "Protection of the Reich" obligations, and one of the bases of the spearheading German fly contender wing, JG 7. Since this was not a long way from Rostock-Marienehe (the present neighborhood), where the Heinkel company's seaside manufacturing plant runway was found, it was simpler for the pilots of I./JGÃÂ 1 to get the new streams. Be that as it may, with Germany on the precarious edge of breakdown, transportation and fuel supply was getting troublesome with the expanded Allied air assaults. 

On 7 April 1945, 134 B-17 Flying Fortresses shelled the field at Parchim. In two days, I./JGÃÂ 1 moved to a close-by landing strip at Ludwigslust. They moved again seven days after the fact to Leck. Around this time, II./JGÃÂ 1 had moved to landing strip at Marienehe and furthermore begun taking conveyance of the He 162. These new fly airplane could never observe across the board battle with JGÃÂ 1 because of their late presentation and a lack of pilots, air ship and fuel. JGÃÂ 1 could never again field their full supplement or successfully fly tasks as required. 

The new He 162 had around 30 minutes worth of fuel. This continuance was essentially insufficient, and somewhere around two JGÃÂ 1 pilots were slaughtered making Deadstick arriving in the wake of debilitating their fuel. By April, I./JGÃÂ 1 had scored various slaughters, however at the expense of 13 He 162s and 10 pilots. The misfortunes were for the most part credited to issues with the He 162, for example, motor fire outs or intermittent basic disappointments, which can most likely be ascribed to poor plan and deficient advancement time. On 24 April 1945, III./JGÃÂ 1 was disbanded. 

On 19 April no less than one He 162 of 3./JGÃÂ 1 succumbed to a Hawker Tempest of 222 Squadron. "Leutnant" Gerhard Steimer composed: 

"We took off from the solid runway in Leck, Kirchner (Fhj.Fw GÄÅºnther Kirchner) remained 30 meters behind me on my correct side as usual;... We ascended to around 200 meters, when abruptly two Thunderbolts showed up behind us and quickly shot down GÄÅºnther Kirchner's plane. I saw him cast off shelter and launch however his parachute did not send. I was fortunate that the Thunderbolts did not proceed with another assault." 

The battle coordinates a record by Flight Lieutenant G. Walkington of 222 Squadron who detailed shooting down a bizarre looking German air ship while on equipped observation in the region. This was the principal loss of a He 162 in battle. 

On 30 April 1945, II./JGÃÂ 1 was joined with I./JGÃÂ 1 at Leck to frame two new gatherings ("Gruppen"): I. (Einsatz)/JGÃÂ 1 and II. (Sammel)/JGÃÂ 1; a consolidated aggregate of around 50 pilots and flying machine. On 4 May 1945, the majority of JGÃÂ 1's enduring He-162s were framed into an uncommon combined "Mediation gatherings" ("Einsatzgruppen"). Be that as it may, on 5 May 1945, the war finished with Germany's surrender. The terms of the surrender necessitated that the Luftwaffe stop all tasks.. Enduring JGÃÂ 1 groups thusly turned their He 162s over to the Allies. 

The Gruppe's 700th triumph happened on 29 April 1944, credited to "Oberlt." von Kirchmayr as his fifteenth murder. There were a few high-scoring pilots related with JGÃÂ 1. For instance, Alfred Grislawski had a score of 134 to his name, Georg-Peter Eder had 78, and Walter Oesau had 127 affirmed preceding his demise. 

Be that as it may, misfortunes were additionally high. Five of the fourteen Group officers ("Gruppenkommandeure") of II./JGÃÂ 1 were executed in real life while presenting with II./JGÃÂ 1. The prominent misfortunes were "Oberleutnant" Rohwer, and "Hauptmanns" Kijewski, Wickop, Seegatz and DÄÂ¤hne. Amid mid 1944, before D-Day, II./JGÃÂ 1 was driven by one of its four experienced development commandants. These were "Hauptmann" Segatz, Major BÄÂ¤r, and "Oberleutnants" von Kirchmayr and Eder. However the unit endured substantial misfortunes (alongside most different wings in the West) of 48 pilots slaughtered, 23 injured, and 158 air ship demolished for 164 affirmed triumphs. Of these, 119 were USAAF four-engined aircraft. 

Altogether, the exceedingly experienced and crucial specialists were among the misfortunes. The most eminent loss of II./JGÃÂ 1 was its "Kommandeur", "Hauptmann" Seegatz (KIA 8 March 1944, 40 murders). The Group likewise lost seven experienced pilots. 

Whenever 8./JGÃÂ 1 (initially 7./JGÃÂ 51) was exchanged from Eastern front, it had 15 pilots in May 1944. By August, twelve pilots had been murdered, one caught and another seriously injured; just "Leutnant" GÄÅºnther Heckmann was the sole pilot remaining. 

The Luftwaffe units resolved to fight after the D-Day arrivals endured further calamitous misfortunes against the staggering quantities of partnered warriors present. In the ten weeks of activity following D-Day, II./JGÃÂ 1 lost 106 flying machine (41 in air battle) and 30 pilots, for only 32 air cases. Many experienced and imperative "Experte" were killed amid this time. "Hauptmann" Karl-Heinz Weber, "Gruppenkommandeur" of III./JGÃÂ 1 (136 cases) was murdered in real life against Polish Wing Mustangs on 7 June 1944, north of Paris, while on 17 June 1944, "Leutnant" 'Toni' Piffer (35 claims) was shot down and executed in aeronautical battle with USAAF warriors over La Cordonnerie. 

On 16 June 1944, while 8./JGÃÂ 1 was moving from Le Mans to Essay, France went under assault by the P-51s of 354th Fighter Wing, close AlenÄÂ§on. In the following dogfight, 8./JGÃÂ 1 lost three pilots and one specialist riding traveler. Those were "Uffz." GÄÅºnther Henschel, "Uffz." Franz Zechner, and "Feldwebel" Helmuth Heidemann. The repairman was "Uffz." Herbert Redlich. Additionally lost were two other flying machine without loss of life.> 

Absolute pilot misfortunes in World War II were 464 slaughtered in real life, 174 injured, 94 executed in mishaps, and 16 POW. 

Initially JGÃÂ 1 was framed as a solitary Group I./JGÃÂ 1 in 1938. A full wing was framed just in November 1939. The primary Wing Commander was Schumacher. 

Initially JG 1 was shaped just as a solitary gathering I./JG 1 under Woldenga. That bunch was re-assigned as III./JG 27. JG 1 subsequently incidentally stopped to exist. It was reactivated 7 months after the fact under Schumacher in November 1939. Be that as it may, a formal I./JG 1 came to exist in September 1941. 

In April 1943, III./JG 1 was re-assigned as I./JG 11. Another gathering was added to JG 1 as III./JG 1 dependent on Operation squadrons of Fighter schools.
