When they did as such, the FIA found concealed usefulness in the two groups' product, yet no proof that it had been utilized in a race. The two groups were fined $100,000 for their underlying refusal to coordinate. Be that as it may, the McLaren programming, which was a gearbox program that permitted programmed shifts, was considered legitimate. On the other hand, the Benetton programming was regarded to be a type of "dispatch control" that would have permitted Schumacher to make immaculate begins, which was expressly banned by the guidelines. In any case, there was no proof to propose that this product was really utilized. 

At the , Schumacher was punished for surpassing on the arrangement lap. He at that point overlooked the punishment and the resulting dark banner, which shows that the driver should promptly come back to the pits, for which he was excluded and later given a two-race boycott.
