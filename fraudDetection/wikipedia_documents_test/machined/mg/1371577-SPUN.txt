London Necropolis railroad station 

London Necropolis railroad station was the Waterloo, London end of the London Necropolis Railway. The London Necropolis Railway was opened in 1854 as a response to extreme congestion in London's current burial grounds and graveyards. It intended to utilize the as of late created innovation of the railroad to move whatever number entombments as could be expected under the circumstances to the recently fabricated Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey. This area was inside simple voyaging separation of London, yet far sufficiently off for the dead not to represent any hazard to open cleanliness. There were two areas for the station; the first was in activity from 1854 to 1902, the second from 1902 to 1941. 

In spite of the fact that it had its own branch line into Brookwood Cemetery, the majority of the course of the London Necropolis Railway kept running on the current London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Thus, a site was chosen in Waterloo, close to the LSWR's as of late opened London end at Waterloo Bridge station (presently London Waterloo). The structure was explicitly intended for the utilization of grievers. It had numerous private sitting areas, which could likewise be utilized to hold memorial service administrations, and a pressure driven lift to raise boxes to stage level. Existing railroad curves were utilized for the capacity of bodies. 

In 1899 the area of the end was hindering the extension of Waterloo station. After much exchange, the LSWR achieved concurrence with the London Necropolis Company, the proprietors of the burial ground and the railroad: as a byproduct of the current site, the LSWR re-prepared the London Necropolis Railway and provided it with another station on Westminster Bridge Road. This new structure was intended to diverge from other burial service chiefs' premises by being as alluring as could be expected under the circumstances. In 1902 the railroad moved into the new structure, and the prior station was devastated. 

On 16 April 1941, amid World War II the station was intensely harmed in an air attack. A great part of the structure was devastated and the tracks to the station were rendered unusable. Albeit some burial service trains kept on running from adjacent Waterloo station, the London end was never utilized again. Following the finish of the war the London Necropolis Company chose that reviving the London Necropolis Railway was not monetarily advantageous, and the enduring piece of the station building was sold as office space. This leftover stays flawless, and generally unaltered since its opening. 

In the principal half of the 19thÃ¢Â century the number of inhabitants in London dramatically increased, from a little under a million people in 1801 to very nearly over two million out of 1851. The city's dead had been covered in and around the nearby places of worship. With a constrained measure of room for entombments, the most established graves were consistently unearthed to free space for new internments. Notwithstanding the fast development in populace, the measure of land put aside for use as memorial parks stayed unaltered at roughly 300Ã¢Â acres (0.5Ã¢Â sqÃ¢Â mi; 1.2Ã¢Â km), spread crosswise over around 200 little destinations. Indeed, even moderately new graves must be uncovered to free up space for new internments, their substance being uncovered and dispersed. Rotting bodies polluted the water supply, and the city endured ordinary pandemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. A Royal Commission built up in 1842 to research the issue presumed that London's graveyard had turned out to be overcrowded to the point that it was difficult to burrow another grave without slicing through a current one. In 1848Ã¢ÂÂ49 a cholera pandemic slaughtered 14,601 individuals in London and overpowered the internment framework totally. 

In the wake of open concerns following the cholera pandemics and the discoveries of a Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851. Under the Burials Act, new entombments were restricted in what were then the developed zones of London. 

Sir Richard Broun and Richard Sprye proposed to utilize the developing innovation of motorized land transport to tackle the issue of London's dead. Broun and Sprye conceived purchasing a solitary extremely vast tract of land around from London in Brookwood close Woking, Surrey, to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis. 

At this separation, the land would be a long ways past the most extreme foreseen size of the city's development, extraordinarily decreasing any potential risks. The London and South Western RailwayÃÂ (LSWR)ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ which had associated London to Woking in 1838Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ would empower bodies and grievers to be transported from London to the site effectively and economically. In spite of the fact that the Brookwood site was a long separation from London, Broun and Sprye contended that the speed of the railroad made it both speedier and less expensive to reach than the seven existing graveyards, all of which required a moderate and costly steed attracted funeral car to convey the body and grievers from London to the entombment site. 

On 30 June 1852 the advertisers of the Brookwood conspire were given Parliamentary agree to continue, and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company (LNC) was shaped. The previous Woking Common, possessed by the Earl of Onslow at Brookwood was picked as the site for the new burial ground. To keep the LSWR from misusing its restraining infrastructure on access to the burial ground, the private Act of Parliament approving the plan bound the LSWR to convey bodies and grievers to the graveyard in ceaselessness and set a most extreme levy which could be demanded on memorial service traffic, yet did not indicate detail of how the burial service trains were to work. 

On 7 November 1854 the new burial ground opened and the southern Anglican segment was sanctified by Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester. On 13 November the principal planned London Necropolis Railway train left the new London Necropolis railroad station for the graveyard, and the primary internment (that of the stillborn twins of a Mr and Mrs Hore of Ewer Street, Southwark Borough) occurred. 

A site for the London end close Waterloo had been recommended by Sir Richard Broun. Its nearness to the River Thames implied that bodies could be efficiently transported to the end by water from quite a bit of London, while being arranged almost three noteworthy Thames spans implied that the zone was effectively gotten to from both north and south of the stream by street. The curves of the enormous block viaduct conveying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station (presently London Waterloo station) were effectively changed over into morgues. Broun likewise learned about that the voyage of London from Waterloo Bridge would be less troubling for grievers: while a large portion of the rail courses out of London went through passages and profound cuttings, or through thickly populated regions, as of now the urban advancement of what is presently south London had not occurred and the LSWR course ran on the whole through parkland and farmland. The LNC additionally considered assuming control over the LSWR's previous end at Nine Elms railroad station (which following the 1848 opening of the substantially more helpful Waterloo Bridge station was utilized just for merchandise traffic, contracted trains taking transients to North America, and the private trains of the imperial family) as either the primary or an auxiliary end. Notwithstanding protests from nearby inhabitants worried about the impacts of possibly extensive quantities of dead bodies being put away in a to a great extent neighborhood, in March 1854 the LNC settled on a solitary end in Waterloo and bought a plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street (presently Leake Street) for the site. 

Designer William Tite and specialist William Cubitt drew up a plan for a station, which was affirmed in June 1854. The station was finished in October 1854, at an absolute development cost of ÃÅ23,231Ã¢Â 14sÃ¢Â 4d (about ÃÅ regarding 2019 spending power). On 13 November 1854 the main train left London for the new London Necropolis. 

Tite and Cubitt's structure was based around a three-story fundamental structure, isolated from the LSWR's principle viaduct by a private access street underneath the LNC's twin rail lines. The private access street was expected to enable grievers to arrive and leave circumspectly, and to maintain a strategic distance from the requirement for hearses to stop in the open street. The ground floor contained a great passageway corridor and staircase for grievers going to first and below average memorial services, a littler passage lobby and staircase for those going to bring down classes of burial service, and two morgues which involved most of the floor. A vast room nearby the funeral home held a save load of around 300 boxes. Most grievers would have charged their own pine boxes, or utilized caskets purchased by the expired amid their lifetime at the same time, clarified an authority of the LNC (in 1898) the save of boxes was kept so that "should a visitor kick the bucket in an inn, and the landowner wished to keep it calm, we are advised, and amidst the night we desire the cadaver, and remove it in one of our instant wooden jackets". The primary floor held the LNC's meeting room, the LNC's funerary workshops, a progression of discrete lounge areas for those going to second and second rate class memorial services, and the structure's principle toilets. The second floor, level with the LSWR railroad line, held the train shed covering the two private rail lines and the single stage at which the trains halted, eight or nine sitting areas for five star grievers, and further toilets for their utilization. A steam-controlled lift conveyed pine boxes from the lower floors to the stage level. A glass rooftop was situated all together that no shadow be thrown on the funeral car carriage holding up at the stage at the time the trains were planned to leave, and the western divider was austere to keep away from travelers utilizing the LSWR station having the capacity to see into the Necropolis station. Glass boards inset between the two rail lines permitted daylight through to the private access street underneath. Not at all like most railroad stations of the period, the plans of the main, second and second rate class sitting areas were to a great extent indistinguishable with just shallow contrasts. 

In spite of the fact that the first end did not have its own house of prayer, on certain events grievers would not be capable or willing to make the voyage to a function at Brookwood however for individual or religious reasons were unfit to hold the memorial service in a London church. On these events one of the sitting areas would be utilized as a stopgap memorial service house of prayer. One of the more remarkable burial services to be held at the end was that of Friedrich Engels, co-maker (with Karl Marx) of present day socialism, who kicked the bucket in London on 5 August 1895. Engels had communicated a desire to be incinerated and his fiery debris dispersed adrift, yet there was no crematorium close London. The LNC had a course of action with Woking Crematorium, by which Necropolis Railway stations and prepares could be utilized by grievers going to incinerations at Woking. For Engels' burial service on 10 August 1895 around 150 individuals went to a morning administration in a lounge area at the LNC end. Despite the fact that the incineration was booked for 1:15Ã¢Â pm customs with the demise testament deferred the takeoff, and the uncommon train did not touch base at the graveyard's North station (the station serving the piece of the burial ground saved for non-Anglicans) until after 4:00Ã¢Â pm. Most of the grievers stayed at North station in the graveyard, and just 12 grievers went with the casket to Woking; as the administration had just been held in London, on landing in Woking, Engels' body was exchanged straight from the funeral wagon to the heater. Engels' slag (incinerated remains) were recuperated from the heater and exchanged to an unrecorded area in Brookwood Cemetery, and after 17 days expelled from the burial ground and dispersed from Beachy Head (in East Sussex). Karl Marx's little girl Eleanor Marx passed on in 1898 and was likewise incinerated at Woking following an administration at the LNC's London end (most likely in a similar room in which Engels' administration had been held three years already) and carriage to North station by the Necropolis Railway. Woking Crematorium, first utilized for human incineration in 1885, participated intimately with the LNC, as they would have liked to anticipate the LNC building their very own crematorium at Brookwood. The LNC never manufactured their very own crematorium, in spite of the fact that a columbarium (working for the capacity of incineration fiery debris) was added to Brookwood Cemetery in 1910. 

For incredibly extensive burial services, for example, those of real open figures, the LSWR would give extra trains from Waterloo to Brookwood station on the fundamental line to satisfy the need. Charles Bradlaugh, Member of Parliament for Northampton, was a vocal backer of Indian self-government and a well known figure among the Indian people group in London, a significant number of whom went to his memorial service on 3 February 1891. More than 5,000 grievers, including 21-year-old Mohandas Gandhi, were carried on three long exceptional LSWR trains, one of which was 17 carriages in length. 

In 1874, with Waterloo Bridge station winding up amazingly occupied, the LSWR endeavored to assume control more than one of the LNC's two rail lines. A 1875 understanding between the LSWR and LNC allowed the LSWR to assume control over the westernmost track (that not served by the stage), as an end-result of improved terms on the rent of the land at present rented by the LNC from the LSWR, and the LSWR assuming control over the upkeep of the structure supporting the LNC lines. In 1876 and 1877 the rooftop and western mass of the LNC train shed were wrecked and supplanted with a cantilevered overhang over the single stage; the stage was reached out to make up for the loss of the second line. 

In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge station in 1886) was furnished with new flags, which required a gantry traversing every one of the lines into the station. As an end-result of the LSWR cladding the LNC's passage on Westminster Bridge Road with white coated block, the LNC gave assent for the stanchion supporting the gantry to lay on the LNC's stage, while maintaining whatever authority is needed to request the gantry be expelled. As of now the LSWR additionally rented a little plot of land west of the Westminster Bridge Road access to fill in as the site of new workplaces for the LNC, structured by Cyril Bazett Tubbs. 

As the site of the Necropolis station had been purposefully adjoined the curves of the LSWR's viaduct, it went about as an impediment to any expansion in the quantity of lines serving Waterloo station. Urban development in the territory of what is currently south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, prompted blockage at the station, just marginally mitigated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. During the 1890s the circumstance wound up illogical, and the LSWR started to explore the likelihood of repositioning the LNC station to allow the extension of the primary line end. 

In 1896 the LSWR formally gave the LNC a proposition to furnish the LNC with another station as a byproduct of the current station. The LNC consented to the proposition, yet with various conditions joined. The LSWR was to permit the LNC control of the structure of the new station, rent the new station to the LNC for a token lease in unendingness, give new moving stock, evacuate any cutoff on the quantity of travelers utilizing the Necropolis administration, and give the free carriage of hardware and gear to be utilized in the burial ground. The LNC had an amazingly solid arranging position as their current site was urgent to any development of Waterloo station, and also they had the lawful appropriate to request the expulsion of the stanchion supporting Waterloo's flag gantry. Despite the fact that the LSWR was amazingly miserable at what they thought about over the top requests, they had no real option except to agree. In May 1899 the organizations consented to an arrangement, in which the LSWR surrendered to each LNC request. Furthermore the LSWR paid ÃÅ12,000 pay (about ÃÅ as far as 2019 shopper spending power) for the bother of migrating the LNC station and workplaces, and concurred that grievers coming back from the graveyard could go on any LSWR train to Waterloo, Vauxhall or Clapham Junction. 

The site for the substitution end was distinguished in 1896, and purchased by the LSWR in 1899 for ÃÅ5,500 (about ÃÅ as far as 2019 customer spending power). South of the current station and on the contrary side of Westminster Bridge Road, its primary passageway was at 121 Westminster Bridge Road. The site was generally S-molded: the passageway from Westminster Bridge Road prompted a segment of land at a correct point to the passage and running behind existing structures on Westminster Bridge Road. This thusly prompted the area distinguished for the two new rail lines, at a correct point to the focal strip (for example parallel to the passage). Work on the new station started in the late spring of 1900, and was finished on 8 February 1902 at an all out development cost to the LSWR of ÃÅ43,494 (about ÃÅ as far as 2019 customer spending power) barring the expense of the land. 

While development was in progress the first end stayed being used, despite the fact that the LSWR was conceded running rights through the station. On 23 February Major J. W. Pringle of the Board of Trade investigated the new structure and communicated worries over the wellbeing of the game plans for trains entering the station from the principle line, which involved intersection the LSWR's various tracks. He was likewise troubled about the recently introduced traveler lifts and the incomplete idea of the traveler end, however in any case affirmed the constrained utilization of the new station for burial service trains. Not long after the exchange of LNC administrations to the new structure the LSWR viaduct was extended to serve an incredibly amplified Waterloo station, obliterating all hints of the first LNC end. 

The new structure, likewise planned by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, was intended for engaging quality and advancement to appear differently in relation to the customary melancholy style related with the burial service industry. A limited four-story place of business remained at 188 Westminster Bridge Road. The ground floor was taken up by an expansive curve prompting a lounge area, an office for general enquiries, and the long carport prompting the station itself; over this were the LNC's workplaces and meeting rooms. 

Top notch grievers entered through the garage under the place of business which turned pointedly left to keep running underneath a glass shade parallel to Westminster Bridge Road; this stretch was looked with coated white block and fixed with palm and sound trees. The garage kept running past funeral homes and storerooms to the lifts and stairs to the stages, and furthermore to an optional passage on Newnham Terrace (off Hercules Road). Over the funeral homes and storerooms were the LNC's workshops. Lifts and an expand fashioned iron staircase drove from the lower two stories to stage level on the second floor. This upper dimension housed a lavish oak-framed Chapelle Ardente, proposed for grievers unfit to make the voyage to Brookwood to offer their regards to the perished. A short and wide pathway prompted the top of the line stage, fixed with sitting areas and a ticket office; the top notch stage was outfitted with five separate lounge areas to keep grievers from various burial service parties independent. 

A glass screen isolated the five star stage and circling region from the stage and flowing territory for second rate class travelers. The second rate class segment was entered from the optional passage in Newnham Terrace, and was all the more scantily outfitted and not furnished with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase prompted a solitary public sitting area on the primary floor, and to the second rate class stage on the second floor, a lot shorter than the top notch stage. 

There was as yet a capacity to transport extensive gatherings on events. The memorial service of Indian agent Sir Nowroji Saklatwala on 25 July 1938 saw 155 grievers voyaging top of the line on a committed LNC train. 

The London Necropolis Company offered three classes of memorial services. A top of the line burial service permitted the individual purchasing the memorial service to choose their preferred grave site anyplace in the graveyard; at the season of opening, top of the line costs started at ÃÅ2Ã¢Â 10s (about ÃÅ in 2019 terms) for an essential plot with no uncommon pine box particulars. It was normal by the LNC that those utilizing top of the line graves would erect a changeless dedication or something to that affect at the appointed time following the memorial service. Inferior memorial services cost ÃÅ1 (about ÃÅ in 2019 terms) and permitted some authority over the internment area. The privilege to raise a changeless dedication cost an extra 10 shillings (about ÃÅ in 2019 terms); if a perpetual commemoration was not raised the LNC claimed all authority to re-utilize the grave in future. Second rate class memorial services were held for homeless person memorial services; those covered at ward cost in the area of the burial ground assigned for that area. In spite of the fact that the LNC was illegal from utilizing mass graves (other than the internment of closest relative in a similar grave) and in this manner even the most reduced class of burial service gave a different grave to the expired, second rate class memorial services were not conceded the privilege to raise a lasting dedication on the site. (The groups of those covered could pay a short time later to update a second rate class grave to a higher class in the event that they later needed to raise a dedication, yet this training was uncommon.) Despite this present, Brookwood's homeless person graves conceded more pride to the perished than did different burial grounds and graveyards of the period, all of which other than Brookwood proceeded with the act of mass graves for poor people. Brookwood was one of only a handful couple of graveyards to allow internments on Sundays, which settled on it a well known decision with the poor as it enabled individuals to go to memorial services without the need to take a vacation day work. As showy exhibitions were restricted on Sundays right now, it additionally settled on Brookwood a well known decision for the internment of performing artists for a similar reason, to the degree that on-screen characters were furnished with a devoted area of the burial ground close to the station entrance. 

For those second rate class burial services paid for by the ward, two second rate class tickets would be given at the area's cost (one ticket on account of a kid's demise). Further grievers for second rate class memorial services were obliged to pay for their own tickets to the Necropolis. 

On landing in the end the grievers would be driven either to one of the devoted top of the line sitting areas (for first and below average memorial services) or to the mutual second rate class lounge area. The pine box would be prudently emptied from the funeral car and sent to the stage level by lift. Those going to first and below average burial services would be allowed to watch the boxes being stacked onto the train in the event that they so wished. (After the movement to the new London end in 1902, some burial service administrations would be held in the Chapelle Ardente at stage level, for those situations where grievers were unfit to make the adventure to Brookwood.) Each entryway of the holding up train would be marked with the name of the expired, to guarantee all travelers went with the right memorial service party; the names of the perished being carried on the train would be brought thus, and that individual's grievers would board the train. 

At the time the administration was introduced, the LNC's trains were isolated both by class and by religion, with discrete Anglican and Nonconformist segments of the train. This qualification connected to both living and dead travelers. Proposed to keep people from various social foundation from blending and possibly troubling grievers and to keep collections of people from various social classes being conveyed in a similar compartment instead of to give distinctive offices, the carriages planned for all classes and religions were fundamentally the same as in structure, and the essential contrast was diverse ornamentation on the compartment entryways. 

At 11.35Ã¢Â am (11.20Ã¢Â am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, landing at Necropolis Junction (where the branch line into the burial ground left the principle LSWR line) at 12.25Ã¢Â pm (12.20Ã¢Â pm on Sundays). 

The train possibly ran if there was a casket or travelers at the London end holding on to utilize it, and both the adventure from London to Brookwood and the later return would be dropped if no one was because of leave London that morning. It would not run if there was just a solitary third or inferior pine box to be conveyed, and in these cases the pine box and memorial service gathering would be held until the following administration. For the most part the trains ran direct from London to the burial ground, other than infrequent stops to take on water. Somewhere in the range of 1890 and 1910 the trains likewise some of the time ceased at Vauxhall and Clapham Junction to support grievers from south west London who did not have any desire to travel by means of the Waterloo end, yet these middle of the road stops were stopped and never reestablished. After 1 October 1900 the Sunday trains were ceased, and from 1902 the day by day train administration was finished and prepares ran just as required. 

Amid the Second World War Waterloo station and the adjacent Thames spans were a critical focus for Axis besieging, and there were a few close misses on the Necropolis station amid the London Blitz of 1940Ã¢ÂÂ41. Despite the fact that there were a few interferences to the Necropolis train administration attributable to foe activity somewhere else hanging in the balance, the Necropolis station was intact amid the beginning periods of the besieging effort, and administrations for the most part proceeded as ordinary. 

Amid the evening of 16Ã¢ÂÂ17 April 1941, in one of the keep going significant air assaults on London, bombs over and over fell on the Waterloo territory, and the LNC's favorable luck in maintaining a strategic distance from harm to their offices at last ran out. In the beginning times of the air attack the moving stock put away in the Necropolis siding was singed, and the railroad curve associating the primary line to the Necropolis end was harmed, despite the fact that the terminal structure itself stayed sound. 

At 10.30Ã¢Â pm numerous flammable gadgets and high dangerous bombs struck the focal area of the end building. While the place of business and stages endure, the workshops, carport and Chapelle Ardente were pulverized, alongside the second rate class sitting area. The Divisional Engineer of the Southern Railway (SR, which had consumed the LSWR in the 1923 rebuilding of Britain's railroads) reviewed the harm at 2.00Ã¢Â pm on 17 April, and his report read basically "Necropolis and structures decimated". 

On 11 May 1941 the station was formally announced shut. The keep going recorded memorial service carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish (1868Ã¢ÂÂ1941), covered on 11 April 1941. The SR offered the LNC the brief utilization of stage 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to enable the administration to be proceeded, yet would not enable the LNC to keep on pitching shoddy tickets to guests going to and from the burial ground stations other than those associated with a memorial service that day, which means those meeting the graveyard had little motivation to pick the LNC's sporadic and rare trains over the SR's quick and incessant administrations to their very own Brookwood railroad station. The LNC endeavored to arrange an arrangement by which "real" grievers could even now make a trip economically to the burial ground on the 11.57Ã¢Â am administration to Brookwood (the SR administration nearest to the LNC's conventional takeoff time), yet the SR the executives (themselves under extreme monetary weight inferable from wartime requirements and harm) would not engage any trade off. 

In September 1945, after the finish of threats, the chiefs of the LNC met to think about whether to reconstruct the end and revive the London Necropolis Railway. In spite of the fact that the fundamental line from Waterloo to Brookwood had stayed being used all through the war and was in great condition, the branch line from Brookwood into the graveyard had been practically unused since the devastation of the London end. With the dirt of the burial ground making the branch crumble notwithstanding when it had been being used and normally kept up, the branch line was in amazingly poor condition. 

Despite the fact that the first advertisers of the plan had visualized Brookwood Cemetery turning into London's principle or just burial ground, the plan had never been as prevalent as they had trusted. In the first proposition, Sir Richard Broun had determined that over its first century of activities the graveyard would have seen around five million entombments at a rate of 50,000 every year, the extraordinary lion's share of which would have used the railroad. As a general rule at the time the keep going train kept running on 11 April 1941, very nearly 87 years in the wake of opening, just 203,041 individuals had been covered in the burial ground. Before the episode of threats expanded utilization of mechanized street transport had harmed the benefit of the railroad for both the LNC and the SR. Looked with the expenses of remaking the graveyard branch line, fabricating another London end and supplanting the moving stock harmed or demolished noticeable all around assault, the chiefs inferred that "past experience and present changed conditions made the running of the Necropolis private train outdated". In mid-1946 the LNC formally educated the SR that the Westminster Bridge Road end would not be revived. 

The choice incited confused exchanges with the SR over the fate of the LNC offices in London. In December 1946 the executives of the two organizations at long last achieved understanding. The railroad related bits of the LNC site (the lounge areas, the guardian's level and the stages themselves) would go into the immediate responsibility for SR, while the staying enduring parts of the site (the workplace obstruct on Westminster Bridge Road, the carport and the destroyed focal segment of the site) would go to the LNC to utilize or discard as they saw fit. The LNC sold the site to the British Humane Association in May 1947 for ÃÅ21,000 (about ÃÅ as far as 2019 shopper spending power), and the workplaces of the LNC were exchanged to the Superintendent's Office at Brookwood. The SR kept on utilizing the enduring segments of the track as periodic sidings into the 1950s, before clearing what survived from their segment of the site. 

With the majority of the LNC's business being worked by street, a concession to 13 May 1946 enabled the LNC to utilize SR administrations from Waterloo to Brookwood station for burial services, subject to the condition that should the administration be vigorously utilized the SR (British Railways after 1948) maintained whatever authority is needed to limit the quantity of memorial service parties on some random train. Albeit one of the LNC's funeral wagon carriages had endure the shelling it is far-fetched this was ever utilized, and pine boxes were conveyed in the baggage space of the SR's mentors. Pine boxes would either be delivered to Brookwood in front of the memorial service party and transported by street to one of the morgues at the neglected graveyard stations, or travel on a similar SR train as the memorial service gathering to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the entombment site or house of prayer by street. 

The site of the principal end was cleared amid the extension of the viaduct into Waterloo in the mid 20thÃ¢Â century, and no hint of it remains. The greater part of the site of the second station was sold by the LNC and worked over with new office improvements in the years following the second's end World War, yet the place of business on Westminster Bridge Road, over the previous access to the station garage, remains generally unaltered remotely despite the fact that the words "London Necropolis" cut into the stone over the carport have been secured. Restorations and cleaning during the 1980s reestablished the faÄÂ§ade of the structure to an appearance like that of the season of its structure. Other than iron segments in Newnham Terrace which once bolstered the Necropolis Railway tracks, and an enduring area of the inward carport utilized as a vehicle leave, the Westminster Bridge Road building is the main enduring piece of the London Necropolis Railway in London.
