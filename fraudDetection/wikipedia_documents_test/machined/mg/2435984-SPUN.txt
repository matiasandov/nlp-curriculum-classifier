The ship was dispatched into the High Seas Fleet in September 1915. She was equipped with a primary battery of eight 15 cm SK L/45 weapons and had a top speed of . 

"Elbing" took an interest in just two noteworthy tasks amid her vocation. The main, the barrage of Yarmouth and Lowestoft, happened in April 1916; there, she quickly drew in the British Harwich Force. After a month, she partook in the Battle of Jutland, where she scored the primary hit of the commitment. She was intensely occupied with the befuddled battling the evening of 31 May Ã¢ÂÂ 1 June, and soon after 12 pm she was unintentionally slammed by the ship , which tore a gap in the ship's structure. Flooding incapacitated the ship's motors and electrical generators, rendering her immobilized and without power. At around 02:00, a German torpedo pontoon took off the greater part of her team, and after an hour the rest of the men left the ship; they got away in the ship's shaper and were later gotten by a Dutch steamer. 

"Elbing" was long generally speaking and had a light emission a draft of forward. She uprooted at full battle load. Her impetus framework comprised of two arrangements of Marine steam turbines driving two propellers. They were intended to give . These were controlled by six coal-terminated Yarrow water-tube boilers, and four oil-terminated Yarrow boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of . "Elbing" conveyed of coal, and an extra of oil that gave her a scope of roughly at . "Elbing" had a standard group of twenty-one officers and 421 enrolled men, however this was extended in wartime. 

The ship was equipped with eight 15 cm SK L/45 firearms in single platform mounts. Two were set next to each other forward on the forecastle, four were found amidships, two on either side, and two were one next to the other toward the back. She likewise conveyed four 5.2Ã¢Â cm SK L/55 hostile to airplane firearms, however these were supplanted with a couple of two SK L/45 against air ship weapons. She was additionally furnished with a couple of torpedo tubes mounted on the deck. She could likewise convey 120 mines. The conning tower had thick sides, and the deck was concealed with to thick reinforcement plate. 

"Elbing" was requested by the Imperial Russian Navy as "Chief naval officer Nevelskoy" from the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig. She was set down in 1913, demanded by the German Navy on 5 August 1914, and was renamed "Elbing". She was propelled on 21 November 1914, after which fitting-out work started. She was charged into the High Seas Fleet on 4 September 1915. 

After her authorizing, "Elbing" was doled out to the II Scouting Group, which normally worked close by the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group. Her first real task was the assault of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24Ã¢ÂÂ25 April. On the way to deal with Lowestoft, "Elbing" and detected the Harwich Force, a squadron of three light cruisers and eighteen destroyers, moving toward the German arrangement from the south at 04:50. Back Admiral Friedrich Boedicker, the German authority, at first arranged his battlecruisers to proceed with the barrage, while "Elbing" and the other five light cruisers concentrated to connect with the Harwich Force. At around 05:30, the British and German light powers conflicted, terminating generally at long range. The battlecruisers touched base on the scene at 05:47, inciting the British squadron to withdraw at fast. A light cruiser and destroyer were harmed before Boedicker severed the commitment in the wake of accepting reports of submarines in the region. 

In May 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the armada authority, intended to bait a part of the British armada far from its bases and crush it with the whole High Seas Fleet. "Elbing" stayed in the II Scouting Group, appended to the I Scouting Group, for the task. The squadron left the Jade roadstead at 02:00 on 31 May, destined for the waters of the Skagerrak. The principle body of the armada pursued 90 minutes after the fact. At 15:00, posts on "Elbing" detected the Danish steamer "N. J. Fjord"; "Elbing" segregated a couple of torpedo vessels to explore the steamer. Two British cruisers, and , were at the same time steaming to examine the steamer, and after recognizing the German torpedo pontoons, opened flame right away before 15:30. "Elbing" swung to help the destroyers, starting to shoot at 15:32. She immediately scored the primary hit of the fight, on "Galatea", however the shell neglected to detonate. The British swung toward the north back toward the first Battlecruiser Squadron, with "Elbing" as yet terminating at long range. She was joined by and , however the three cruisers needed to stop fire by 16:17, as the British had drawn out of range. Around fifteen minutes after the fact, the three cruisers drew in a seaplane propelled by the seaplane delicate . They neglected to score any hits, yet the airplane was constrained off after which its motor separated and it was compelled to arrive. The three cruisers at that point came back to their stations in front of the German battlecruisers. 

At around 18:30, "Elbing" and the remainder of the II Scouting Group experienced the cruiser ; they opened flame and scored a few hits on the ship. As the two sides' cruisers separated, Rear Admiral Horace Hood's three battlecruisers interceded. His lead scored a hit on "Wiesbaden" that detonated in her motor room and handicapped the ship. "Elbing" and "Frankfurt" each terminated a torpedo at the British battlecruisers, however both missed. "Elbing" was quickly connected by the battlecruisers at exceptionally long range, however she was not hit. At around 20:15, "Elbing" lost her port motor because of breaks in her heater condensers. This restricted her speed to for the following four hours. 

The II Scouting Group, alongside the battlecruisers and had been requested to take station in front of the German line for its night cruising development. "Elbing" was all the while having issues with her evaporator condensers, and was unfit to keep up the speed important to achieve the front of the line, thus she fell in with the IV Scouting Group. At 23:15, "Elbing" and detected the British cruiser and a few destroyers. They utilized the British acknowledgment flag and shut to before turning on their searchlights and starting to shoot. "Castor" was hit multiple times and set ablaze, compelling the British to dismiss. As they did, they terminated a few torpedoes at "Elbing" and "Hamburg". One go underneath "Elbing" yet neglected to detonate. While this commitment was still on-going, the second Light Cruiser Squadron arrived and connected with the IV Scouting Group. "Elbing" was hit once, which wrecked her remote transmitting station and slaughtered four men and injured twelve. 

Soon after 12 pm, the German armada kept running into the British back destroyer screen. "Elbing" was at this point steaming on the port side of the German line alongside "Hamburg" and "Rostock". The man of war Ã¢ÂÂthe first ship in the German lineÃ¢ÂÂopened fire first, pursued rapidly by "Elbing", the other two cruisers, and the war vessels and . The British destroyers propelled a torpedo assault, which constrained the three cruisers to swing to starboard to maintain a strategic distance from them. This pointed the cruisers legitimately at the German line. "Elbing" endeavored to steam among "Nassau" and , yet "Posen"s commander didn't know about the development until it was past the point where it is possible to maintain a strategic distance from an impact. "Posen" swung hard to starboard, yet at the same time slammed into "Elbing"s starboard quarter. The cruiser was holed beneath the waterline, which overwhelmed the starboard motor room first. She at first took on a rundown of eighteen degrees, which enabled water to spread to the port motor room. With the motors shut down, steam started to gather in the funnels, which debilitated the electric generators and made the ship lose electrical power. As water spread all through the ship's motor compartments, the rundown was diminished. The ship was totally immobilized, however she was not in peril of sinking. 

At 02:00, the torpedo pontoon came close by and took off 477 officers and men of "Elbing"s team. Her administrator and a little gathering of officers and men stayed ready.

They at that point brought down the ship's shaper into the water and set off; while steaming back to port, they protected the specialist from the destroyer . At around 07:00, a Dutch trawler met the shaper and took the men to Holland. Throughout the Battle of Jutland, "Elbing" had terminated 230 rounds of 15Ã¢Â cm ammo and a solitary torpedo. Four of her group were slaughtered and twelve more were injured.
