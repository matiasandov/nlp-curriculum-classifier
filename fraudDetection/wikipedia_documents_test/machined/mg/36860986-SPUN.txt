In November 2018, in front of the 6th season's discharge, the arrangement was reestablished for a seventh season. In the wake of beginning the main season with high appraisals yet blended surveys, the evaluations started to drop while audits improved. This prompted much lower yet progressively steady appraisals, just as more reliably positive audits in the ensuing seasons. 

A few characters made for the arrangement have since been acquainted with the comic universe and other media. A turn off arrangement, focused on Blood and Palicki's characters Lance Hunter and Bobbi Morse and titled "Wonder's Most Wanted", got a pilot request in August 2015, yet it was at last passed on in May 2016. An online computerized arrangement, "", focused on Elena "Yo-Yo" Rodriguez, was propelled in December 2016 on ABC.com. 

The primary season sees S.H.I.E.L.D. Specialist Phil Coulson assembling a little group of S.H.I.E.L.D. specialists to deal with peculiar new cases.

Jeff Ward was elevated to arrangement normal for the 6th season after beforehand repeating as Deke Shaw. 

After The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment in 2009, they declared that a Marvel Television division was being framed under Jeph Loeb. In the next months, different pilots dependent on funnies from Marvel's list went into improvement. In July 2012, Marvel Television went into dialogs with ABC to make another arrangement set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, however by then it was uncertain what it would be. The arrangement was depicted as "'a portion of a thought' with various situations being investigated, including a high-idea cop appear." The following month, it was reported that "Wonder's The Avengers" chief Joss Whedon, maker of other TV programs, for example, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Firefly", would be associated with the arrangement's improvement. 

In August 2012, ABC requested a pilot for an arrangement called "S.H.I.E.L.D." to be composed and coordinated by Joss Whedon, with Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen likewise composing. Disney CEO Bob Iger greenlit the arrangement in the wake of watching the Marvel One-Shot short film "Thing 47". In April 2013, ABC declared that the arrangement would be titled "Wonder's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and it was formally gotten for a full period of 22 scenes in May 2013. Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell go about as the arrangement's showrunners, with Bell joining the show to assist the unpracticed previous pair with employing group individuals and "exploring the legislative issues of studios and systems", saying, "My main responsibility is to enable them to figure out how to do that, to direct the ship while they learn." Joss Whedon helped them before he began chip away at "". 

The arrangement was recharged for a second season in May 2014, a third in May 2015, a fourth in March 2016, a fifth in May 2017, and a 6th in May 2018. ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said the 6th season was not intended to fill in as the arrangement's last season, including that by moving the season to air in mid-2019 would enable ABC to "super-serve the show's group of onlookers and perhaps have it reporting in real time longer." That November, ABC restored the arrangement for a seventh season. 

In September 2016, examining the inevitable end of the arrangement, Tancharoen stated, "You in every case simply move forward. Until somebody guides us to stop, we will keep on pushing ahead." Jed Whedon included, "There are dependably thoughts in the back of your psyche for how you'd wrap it up when they state, 'That is it folks,' however we're not there right now." By May 2017, Bell noted they had "a feeling of how we'd like the show to end when it closes. We simply need to know when that opportunity is approaching so we can work to it appropriately." Jed Whedon proceeded, "we will likely know early, in light of the fact that we would love to arrive the story such that's fantastic". 

Chime clarified that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen direct the majority of the arrangement's innovative choices, frequently counseling with Loeb. At the point when the showrunners are composing the arrangement, one individual can compose a content while the other two break stories, with the goal that a story can be broken at regular intervals. On the off chance that the official makers approve a story, an individual from the arrangement's scholars room at that point delivers a diagram, gets notes on it from the showrunners, composes a full content, gets notes on it from ABC and the generation group, and after that goes to set to create the scene. 

In January 2013, Joss Whedon redirected any immediate impacts from different arrangement, for example, the endeavors of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in "The X-Files", and clarified that while the show would include individuals with forces and the exhibition of sci-fi narrating, it would concentrate on "the fringe people...the individuals on the edges of the excellent experiences." As the arrangement started to present increasingly fueled people, Bell noticed that crowds "appear to react to controlled individuals on the show and keeping in mind that it won't dominate and progress toward becoming what the show's about, as a surface and kind of the accounts, we truly appreciate that." Jed Whedon expressed that the arrangement would keep on underscoring the overall population's reaction to controlled individuals, saying, "The dynamic on the planet has changed. There was one individual with forces, and afterward by "The Avengers" there were perhaps six all out ... presently they're considerably more pervasive, so there's response from the open dependent on that." 

On the harmony between making new material and drawing from existing folklore, Bell noticed that recounting stories that can engage both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is testing, and that for the arrangement they endeavor to add gestures to the MCU films or the funnies such that functions admirably alone for all watchers, yet could likewise mean more for a fan. On where the arrangement can draw from the funnies, Jed Whedon clarified that there are zones of the funnies that the arrangement isn't permitted to go to, and that at last they just utilize the funnies for motivation in creating their very own story. Tancharoen expounded that, "We're continually going to be roused and impacted by the funnies, obviously on the show, we'll generally be doing our turn to it." About correlations between the extent of the arrangement and that of the movies, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been liberal with the arrangement's financial plan, and that the generation couldn't whine for a system arrangement, however that it was nothing contrasted with the movies or even arrangement like "Round of Thrones". He clarified that the arrangement attempts to make "Wonder minutes" as well as can be expected, however called attention to that a portion of the more significant minutes from the movies are littler, character momentsÃ¢ÂÂsomething that works actually well on televisionÃ¢ÂÂso the arrangement makes progress toward those when it can't manage the cost of more extension and scale. Jed Whedon explained that they take a gander at a succession and endeavor to keep just what is required to recount to the story, so "If a beast is arriving on a vehicle, rather than appearing entire beast jumping through the horizon, we need to be in the vehicle with the character having that experience." 

In September 2015, Bell thought back on the initial two seasons and discussed the difficulties of and changes in the arrangement. He noticed the negative gathering from fans concerning the low number of unmistakable characters like Coulson, however indicated out that fans appeared have developed to like the arrangement's unique characters as they had been created after some time. He clarified that with the expanding number of characters and complex connections in the arrangement, having diverse pairings and building new enthusiastic connections was vital, and expressed that "whether it's a tranquil minute or in real life, we [hope to] extend the gathering of people's affection and concern, and trusts in these characters." after a year he emphasized the maker's aim to make a convention pushing ahead of "finding new blends and new clashes" between various arrangements of characters, given "a ton of procedurals [see] similar individuals doing likewise for a long time and the character don't develop or change by any stretch of the imagination." 

The makers and journalists at first shaped a general arrangement for the show through the finish of a third season, in the wake of perusing the screenplays for forthcoming MCU films. In May 2016, Chloe Bennet compared the finish of the third season to "the finish of the primary book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the finish of something greater and the start of an entirely different tone for the show." She explained that "the storylines that we began toward the start of season 1 truly wrapped up toward the finish of season 3. We've had some significant misfortunes of individuals who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the principal day on set, there's unquestionably another vitality of the show" pushing ahead. The arrangement was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the authors wanted to "skew somewhat darker in light of" this change, with Loeb including that "It completely offers openings. I don't have the foggiest idea about that it changes things all that significantly [though]. That is to say, toward the day's end, Marvel is continually going to make demonstrates that run somewhere close to PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to make "Deadpool" at any point in the near future on [ABC]." Marvel "had a long converse with ABC about what would we be able to pull off, in a manner of speaking" in the new timeslot, which prompted the incorporation of Ghost Rider in the season more than one of Marvel's Netflix arrangement, since Marvel felt "that this character was on the whole correct to recount [darker and more violent] stories at the present time" and having him on "S.H.I.E.L.D." helped that since "it was so startling". Loeb trusted that the mix of the later timeslot and the presentation of Ghost Rider would prompt a few watchers who had quit viewing the arrangement over the past seasons giving it another shot. 

In May 2017, in front of the fifth season restoration, Jed Whedon said the essayists didn't know what might occur in the season, and that it would be "on a whim." While starting to compose the last scene of season 5 toward the finish of February 2018, the scholars were getting ready for it to have the capacity to fill in as both a season and arrangement finale, with certain components that could be balanced dependent on whether the arrangement was recharged for a 6th season or not. Whedon included, "we're prepared for if this is the end. We're unquestionably going to make it compensating in any case." 

In October 2012, a throwing sheet for five lead jobs was conveyed. At the New York Comic Con, Joss Whedon, Kevin Feige, and Clark Gregg reported that Gregg would repeat his job as operator Phil Coulson from "Iron Man", "Iron Man 2", "Thor", "The Avengers", and the Marvel One-Shots in the pilot, and would "feature" the arrangement. On-screen character Ming-Na Wen was given a role as Melinda May. The following month, Elizabeth Henstridge and Iain De Caestecker were given a role as Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz, separately, while newcomer Brett Dalton was given a role as Grant Ward. In December, Chloe Bennet was picked out of in excess of 400 performers to play Skye, the 6th and last standard for the primary season; the character is uncovered in the second season to be Daisy Johnson, and never again passes by "Skye" beginning with the third. 

At San Diego Comic-Con 2014, Nick Blood was reported as cast in the job of Lance Hunter for the second season, while the character of Bobbi Morse was uncovered to show up. That August, Henry Simmons joined the give a role as Alphonso "Mack" MacKenzie, a repetitive job, and Adrianne Palicki was given a role as Morse in a visitor job, to initially show up in the scene "A Hen in the Wolf House". The following month, the whole first season essential cast were affirmed to be regulars for the second season, alongside Blood. Palicki went along with them with the scene "Consequential convulsions". In February 2015, Luke Mitchell was given a role as Lincoln Campbell, a repetitive job for the second 50% of the period. 

All season two primary cast individuals returned for the third season, with Simmons and Mitchell going along with them, advanced from their common jobs. In October 2015, the Inhuman Hive was presented; for the second piece of season three, he has the body of Grant Ward, again depicted by Brett Dalton. Likewise presented were Natalia Cordova-Buckley and John Hannah, repeating as Elena "Yo-Yo" Rodriguez and Holden Radcliffe, individually. Blood and Palicki left the principle cast following the season three scene "Separating Shot", to star in the then-arranged turn off show "Wonder's Most Wanted". Dalton and Mitchell additionally left after the passings of their characters in the third-season finale. 

Gregg, Wen, Bennet, De Caestecker, Henstridge, and Simmons returned for the fourth and fifth seasons. They were joined by Hannah in the fourth, with Cordova-Buckley by and by repeating as Rodriguez in the season, before being elevated to an arrangement normal for the fifth season. Dalton returned as a visitor amid the third case of the fourth season, while Blood made his arrival to the arrangement amid the fifth season. Presented in the fifth season was Jeff Ward, who repeated as Deke Shaw. 

Wen, Bennet, De Caestecker, Henstridge, Simmons, and Cordova-Buckley return for the 6th and seventh seasons, and were joined by Ward. Given the occasions of the last scene of season five, in which it is inferred that Coulson kicks the bucket, Gregg noted "there is some enthusiasm for having me associated with" the 6th season, possibly with flashback, and was likewise uncertain on the off chance that he would be an arrangement customary, should he return, as he had been for the past five seasons. With the declaration of the period seven restoration, Gregg was not recorded among the returning cast for that season. 

Betsy Heimann was the outfit creator for the pilot, however left the arrangement because of film duties. Aide ensemble architect Ann Foley took over for ensuing scenes, and worked intimately with Tancharoen to make "extremely solid, diverse characters" whose "looks advance alongside the show." Foley additionally expedited idea specialists Phillip Boutte Jr. what's more, Josh Shaw to help with the plan procedure. Foley observed each MCU film, giving exceptional consideration to "The Avengers", and was additionally roused by such movies as "Skyfall" and "". In October 2016, Foley said that she was explicitly following the tasteful of "", "So any outfit needs to fit inside that world we've built up and needs to fit that strategic look." On the assortment of ensembles made for each character, Foley liked to have set pieces in the characters' "storerooms", as "it is anything but a style show ... a person like Ward won't have twenty coats in his storage room. He will have one that he utilizes constantly." 

In the wake of perusing each content, Foley would do her own examination, before talking about the appearance of the scene with the journalists. She at that point contemplates the funnies, general style, and history to get a look that is unmistakable to fans, however fits into the more practical universe of the arrangement. Outfits are either uniquely crafted or purchased, and the performing artists are acquired for fittings before recording. This procedure was regularly testing because of the arrangement's eight-day-per-scene plan. Foley expressed that all outfits set aside a comparable measure of effort to make, regardless of whether they depend on the funnies or not. Wonder CCO Joe Quesada is associated with the endorsement procedure while costuming prior characters, including Daisy Johnson's Quake ensemble that is presented in the third season. The Quake outfit fuses components from the comic variant of the character, and was planned to demonstrate that Quake "could without much of a stretch be a piece of the Avengers". Foley found a way to separate the Quake ensemble from Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow outfits from the movies, yet was "complimented" by correlations made between them. Foley was additionally inflexible about not sexualising characters, for example, Quake to demonstrate that "these characters don't need to be sexualised, that they're amazing, resilient ladies", thus kept away from "a ton of cleavage, you don't see high heels. It's about common sense." 

The ensembles experience a characteristic development in the arrangement. There is a move toward the finish of the principal season to a darker look, and every one of the characters have "unquestionably grown up" amid the second season. In the third season there is another move, "from the ragtag gathering of fighters and researchers to [a] progressively exact aggressive outfit". This change is additionally reflected in the arrangement's shading palette, going from "an a lot lighter tone, significantly more examples" in the main season to having "stripped away a touch of shading" by the third. Regardless of this expanding haziness in the ensembles, Foley proposed to characterize each character as they are acquainted and with have them generally be unmistakable and recognizable. With the beginning of the fourth season, Foley said that "each season certainly has its very own vibe and this season will be the same. I feel that you're going to see some inconspicuous contrasts in the ensembles of the characters"; she felt like Fitz and Simmons, specifically, had progressed toward becoming "increasingly grown-up looking", while all the cast had "a truly explicit ... regular citizen look" that would turn out to be increasingly unmistakable as S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized and turns out to be progressively open. Foley left the arrangement after the thirteenth scene of the fourth season, to take a shot at a TV adjustment of "Modified Carbon", and was supplanted with Amanda Riley. Riley utilized her past experience reproducing ensembles to "mix in" with Foley's set up look. 

Foley returned for the initial two scenes of the fifth season, before giving over to Whitney Galitz, who had helped Foley on the past couple of seasons, and Christann Chanell. 

The arrangement's props division is driven by Scott Bauer. The pilot presents the Incapacitating Cartridge Emitting Railgun or ICER sedative weapons frequently utilized by the operators, with Joss Whedon having Bauer structure "science fiction" looking firearms including a huge rifle-like weapon. The arrangement further depiction of the ICERs was increasingly unpretentious, with Bauer utilizing airsoft weapons that are protected to shoot others with over a little separation. ICER-explicit gag flashes are then included by the enhanced visualizations office. Bauer reused the ICER rifle prop when making Mack's "Shotgun Ax", which shows up in later seasons. The terrigen gems that open Inhuman capacities in the arrangement are 3D-printed from strong pitch and afterward adjusted with additional subtleties. Extra down to earth impacts and props are made by Legacy Effects, who additionally deal with the MCU films, remarkably making Daisy Johnson's gauntlets for the third season. Prosthetic cosmetics for the arrangement is structured related to Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios. Hetrick started chip away at the arrangement with the second season, to make Raina's Inhuman look, and returned for the third season to plan and make the more "novel"- looking Inhumans, for example, Lash. 

The third season presents another title succession for the arrangement, supplanting the one that showed up in the initial two seasons. The title arrangement in "4,722 Hours" is radically not the same as the structure presented for the third season, with the arrangement's title in the scene's typeface quietly blurring onto the screen over the scenery of the planet Simmons is stranded on. The fourth season sees new arrangement title cards for the "Phantom Rider" and "LMD" units, and a "Specialists of S.H.I.E.L.D." title card for the "Operators of Hydra" case that changes to state "Specialists of Hydra" for scenes essentially set in the Framework. The "Phantom Rider" realistic is utilized again for the fourth-season finale. For the fifth season, the opening of "Introduction" is reminiscent of the grouping for "4,722 Hours", swearing off the title card and having the typeface quietly blurring onto the screen. The consequent scenes of season five component a title card with the arrangement name in another typeface against a setting of different portrayals of Earth: scenes through "Previous existence" highlight a devastated future Earth; scenes from "Principa" through "The Devil Complex" include a present Earth; while scenes from "Rise and Shine" through "All Roads Lead..." include the Earth starting to break. 

Generation for the pilot occurred essentially in Los Angeles to suit Joss Whedon's timetable, while the remainder of the arrangement is principally recorded in Culver City, California. Extra recording has additionally occurred far and wide, incorporating into Paris, France, Stockholm, Sweden, and Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. The arrangement is taped on Arri Alexa cameras, with David Boyd filling in as executive of photography on the pilot, and Feliks Parnell, Jeff Mygatt, and Allan Westbrook doing as such all through the remainder of the arrangement. Garry Brown is the second unit chief for the arrangement, with tricks facilitated by Tanner Gill. The arrangement is recorded in 2K goals. 

FuseFX fills in as the lead special visualizations merchant for "Operators of S.H.I.E.L.D.", with extra work by Pixomondo, Cosa, Greenhaus GFX, Lion VFX, and Synaptic. The arrangement sees a normal of 80 to 150 special visualizations shots for every scene, with 10 to 12 days to take a shot at the impacts for one scene once foundation plates have been gotten from recording. This compares to roughly 2000 enhanced visualizations shots for each season. Imprint Kolpack fills in as enhanced visualizations boss for the arrangement. David Altenau was the in-house boss at FuseFX for "Pilot" through scene eight, with Kevin Lingenfelser taking over for consequent scenes. VFX maker Andrea D'Amico joined the group at FuseFX to deal with the arrangement in December 2015. Two separate generation the board and innovative groups were set up to take a shot at the show, and makers, printers and different specialists had the capacity to exchange scenes. This was critical in light of the fact that a large portion of the scenes must be chipped away at simultaneously, either a few at once. Normal impacts for the arrangement incorporate the making of character-driving impacts liveliness, photograph reasonable vehicles, CG set expansions, fireworks, and air impacts. A few resources, for example, a Quinjet and Helicarrier, are shared from Industrial Light and Magic, however "those models are commonly too substantial and thick with information" and should be made "HD well disposed or basically reasonable to work in [a] TV plan." 

Bear McCreary affirmed that he would form music for the arrangement in July 2013. Not at all like on a portion of his past scores, ABC and Marvel permitted McCreary to work with a full symphonic ensemble, regularly highlighting 50 or 70 players, with more than 90 for "imperative" scenes. Complex synthesizer writing computer programs was likewise utilized, to give the score "a cutting edge". Since "Operators of S.H.I.E.L.D." was the first MCU TV arrangement, McCreary felt there was "a feeling that it needed to associate" to the predictable ensemble sound of the movies, however seen through a TV focal point. McCreary makes by and large 30 minutes of music for every scene. Making the fundamental subject for the arrangement, which McCreary likewise observed as Coulson's topic, was a procedure which took a great deal of cooperation with the official makers, who needed a particular soundÃ¢ÂÂ"something huge, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe" yet additionally "personal in light of the fact that these aren't superheroes, these are customary individuals." McCreary needed to work more enthusiastically to make the topic heard, given that the show does not have a conventional title grouping. By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noticed "the score turned into somewhat more exceptional and all the more electronically determined... [E]lectronics truly moved to the cutting edge as we got into more anecdotes about Inhumans and the advanced world our characters possess. Be that as it may, the symphony is forever our establishment." 

In September 2014, McCreary reported that there were plans for an "Operators of S.H.I.E.L.D." soundtrack, which was discharged carefully a year later by Marvel Music on September 4, 2015, and on CD on October 9. Including music from the initial two seasons, the soundtrack was composed and created by McCreary and Steven Kaplan, with the collection delivered by Joe Augustine with McCreary. 

All music formed by Bear McCreary. Notes alongside each track demonstrate which episode(s) it was included in. 

In July 2013, Jed Whedon said the arrangement would work pair with the Marvel films, both past and forthcoming, to weave in the middle of the movies, and to "attempt to make them all the more remunerating on the two finishes." He clarified that each Marvel venture is planned to remain solitary first before there is any intertwining, and noticed that the arrangement needs to work with the film division and know about their arrangements so as not to meddle while acquainting a person or thing with the universe. Chime explained this was best with the goal that individuals who don't watch the movies can in any case pursue the arrangement, and the other way around. He expressed that "ABC and Marvel both need the arrangement to have the capacity to bode well without anyone else", yet that it was useful for the movies to have the arrangement fill in any "holes" for them, due to being "enormous" and moving "rapidly through a ton of immense pieces", dissimilar to TV which has room schedule-wise to manage more subtleties. 

In January 2016, Joss Whedon noticed that this procedure "shockingly just methods the TV show gets, you know, scraps." He expressed that, for instance, the arrangement's inventive group at first needed to utilize Loki's staff from "The Avengers" however were not able because of Whedon's arrangements for it in "Time of Ultron". On how their capacity to associate with the movies changed over the life of the arrangement, Jed Whedon stated, "The standard when we began was we couldn't utter a word about government agents, we couldn't utter a word about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or on the other hand robots or anything like that, since the majority of that was coming in films that year or the year after. From that point forward, they've exposed those entryways." He included, "We have generally free rein [in what the arrangement can present and interface to]; we can't go anyplace that [the films are] going. They know their accounts such a great amount of farther than we do, which is beneficial for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or stay away from things that they need to be extraordinary on the wide screen. For whatever length of time that we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told "no" that much". For instance, Whedon noticed the fourth season's Framework storyline as "something that is really huge in our reality, but at the same time is a little whirlpool in the waterway that doesn't influence whatever else on the grounds that it's an imaginary world. So those sorts of stories help us pull out all the stops without sending swells through the entire MCU." 

The arrangement emulates the movies' post credits scenes with 'end labels', beginning with the scene "0-8-4" which includes a Samuel L. Jackson appearance. Chime clarified, "Now and again it'll be entertaining, once in a while it'll be a folklore thing ... or then again an additional little uncover about" the scene. The end tag for "End of the Beginning" is a "legitimately lifted" scene from "Skipper America: The Winter Soldier". 

The arrangement's first real connect scene to the more extensive MCU was "The Well", which starts following "". The scenes "End of the Beginning" and "Turn, Turn, Turn" rotate around the occasions of "Chief America: The Winter Soldier", which prompted a retooling of the arrangement. Flashback successions in "Shadows" and "The Things We Bury" including Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter filled in as advertising and set-up for the "Specialist Carter" TV arrangement. The occasions of "The Frenemy of My Enemy" and "The Dirty Half Dozen" hinted at the opening grouping of "Justice fighters: Age of Ultron", while "Scars" manages the result of that film. The third season pursues comparable subjects to the film "", concentrating on fueled individuals and the diverse reactions to them, paving the way to the scene "Liberation", which happens after the film and shows how its occasions influence the arrangement's controlled characters. 

The scene "T.A.H.I.T.I." acquaints the Kree outsider race with the MCU, individuals from which assume a critical job in "Watchmen of the Galaxy". This starts a storyline that repeats all through the arrangement, and acquaints Inhumans with the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something "underway" for quite a while, as Marvel Studios had plans for an "Inhumans" film, and this would be "one of the primary examples where we get the opportunity to begin planting the seeds on the show before the film." The third season presents the idea of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters enlivened by the comic of a similar name, while additionally retconning the historical backdrop of Hydra in the MCU, integrating it with the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the "essayist and executive [of the "Inhumans" film] will have free rein to would what they like to do with the Inhumans, however ideally there'll be some way that our Inhumans associate with that." When the film was expelled from Marvel Studios' discharge plan, Whedon noticed that the arrangement had "somewhat more opportunity" and were "ready to complete somewhat more" with the species going into the fourth season, including the capability of presenting a portion of the "work of art" Inhumans. "Wonder's Inhumans", a TV arrangement focused on Black Bolt and different individuals from the Inhuman Royal Family, was reported in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017.
