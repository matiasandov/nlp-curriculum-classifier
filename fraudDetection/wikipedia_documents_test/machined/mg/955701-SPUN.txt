Lionel Luthor is depicted in the program by John Glover; Glover said he acknowledges the "reasonable canvas" he needed to work with when building up his depiction of Lionel. In season one, Glover ventured out from New York to Vancouver consistently while shooting his scenes since he was at that point resolved to arrange appearances in New York at the time.

The imaginative group explored different avenues regarding Lionel's character in season four, making a storyline in which Lionel is changed. Official maker Greg Beeman said the character advancement fizzled, and therefore Lionel came back to his ordinary self. John Glover discovered playing Lionel as a straight bolt might have been "exhausting". 

Season five investigates the connection among Martha and Lionel. Both Annette O'Toole and Al Gough said Lionel was marginally pulled in to Martha, however that she could never follow up on that feeling. The makers had no goals to make a sentimental connection between the two characters. A large portion of Lionel's inspirations in season five are covered in puzzle. Glover said he couldn't decide if his character is fortunate or unfortunate, so when he is depicting him in season five he attempted to show everything as though it was "great". Glover said he trusts Lincoln Cole's (Ian Tracey) activities in "Kindness" made Lionel reexamine everything his past conduct and his very own character. Before the finish of the fifth season, Lionel has discovered that individuals have a duty to one another. 

"Smallville" essayist and official maker Brian Peterson said the inventive group needed to remind the gathering of people that Lionel was as yet the equivalent Lionel Luthor they had come know, so they deferred uncovering Lionel's standard shenanigans until season six's "Guarantee" in which he extorts Lana into wedding Lex. Peterson needed to "slap [the audience] in the face" with a notice of Lionel's previous character. Despite the fact that Lionel extorts Lana into wedding Lex, John Glover said Lionel was endeavoring to secure Clark, for which he required Lana's assistance. When season six started airing, John Glover acknowledged Lex was beginning to turned out to be increasingly abhorrent and that his time on the show would be constrained. Glover trusted Lionel would even now have the capacity to impact his child as the show advanced; he trusted his character would be futile on the show without such affecting capacities. Glover said the contention among Lex and his dad is extremely positive for the show on the grounds that Lionel's endeavor to bond with Lex and the doubt between them "makes dramatization". 

John Glover portrays Lionel as a businessperson who is frustrated with his child. To Glover, Lionel is this "rich and incredible representative" who sees his child as a "wuss" and "fraidy-feline". It was critical to Glover that Lionel show up as human as could be expected under the circumstances; Glover said he wouldn't like to just "spin [his] mustache". Glover portrayed Lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he needs. He describes Lionel as an astute man who can peruse individuals effectively. Lionel utilizes that capacity to assist his objectives. The character can likewise move beyond individuals' protections and control them. Glover imagines that kind of intensity would be incredible in the event that it could be utilized to help somebody other than Lionel. Lionel's character is additionally suggested by the shading plan that encompasses him; the utilization of virus blue tones inspires the "vile" idea of the character. Lionel is additionally regularly depicted before a white or "clinical blue" foundation. Lionel's mark mane of hair is utilized to symbolize his powerÃ¢ÂÂby developing it out and declining to style it, Lionel endeavors to demonstrate he is powerful to the point that he can do anything he desires with no backfire. 

The connection among Lionel and his child Lex is stressed; it has been compared to the connection among Norman and Harry Osborn in the "Insect Man" film. Glover endeavored to make Lionel seem like he is attempting to "toughen [Lex] up". The character is made to "make a special effort, to give [Lex] tests, so [Lex] can substantiate himself". Glover sees the character as a rich and ground-breaking agent who is disillusioned in his child. Glover's objective for season one was to demonstrate Lionel's endeavors to make Lex harder; he translates the character's adage in his raising of Lex as "no hazard, no prizes". 

Glover trusts Lionel has two contending motivation with LexÃ¢ÂÂfor Lex to turn into his very own man and for Lex to follow in his dad's means. This winds up disappointing for Lex on the grounds that Lionel needs his child to be both "faithful adherent" and the "best individual he can be". This all plays into Lionel's "quite enormous self image". John Glover accepts if Lionel and Lex were not related Lionel would have "decimated" Lex from the get-go on the grounds that he sees his child as "feeble". Lionel is additionally bound by the way that Lex is his beneficiary, despite the fact that he doesn't trust Lex. Lionel's doubt of Lex mostly emerges on the grounds that he trusts Lex is a weakling. John Glover stated, "It isn't so much that [Lionel is] intended to be an enemy; it's simply that the poor kid's frail, so [Lionel must] shape him. Lionel is ceaselessly attempting to reinforce his child, to educate him. [Lex is] only a hard understudy." 

Lionel additionally has a key association with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's supportive mother. This relationship initially creates in season two when Lionel procures Martha to be his collaborator; it is additionally created in season five. Glover felt Lionel's appreciation for Martha develops in season five when Jonathan Kent bites the dust since he currently considers Martha to be a solitary lady and is presently increasingly feasible; Glover trusts Lionel was trying to accomplish Martha's "integrity" and the fascination did not depend on desire. At the point when Lionel is in Martha's organization he endeavors to introduce himself as a man she could be with; he intentionally endeavors to change long periods of narrow minded conduct. Essayist Holly Harold said his association with Martha parallels Lex's association with Lana; the two men trust these two ladies will be their redeeming quality and draw them over from the clouded side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's enthusiasm for Lionel resembles viewing a risky creature; "It's that fascination you have for a delightful, perilous creature. You realize you can't quit watching it, and yet you feel, 'Goodness my God, he's going to execute me.'" O'Toole additionally said she trusts Martha's inspiration is to draw sufficiently near to Lionel to recognize what he is wanting to do to Clark. At the point when Martha left the show, author Todd Slavkin said they needed to give the character "all the more a send-off" than they accomplished on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equal to what they gave John Schneider in light of the fact that there were such a significant number of storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The authors acknowledged they couldn't murder off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, making a parallel to Clark where Martha battles shamefulness on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a little appreciation for Lionel and that nothing genuine would originate from it. 

Glover trusts Martha impacted Lionel to begin trusting that penance is important to make the world a superior spot. When she leaves toward the finish of season six, Lionel never again has that impact. He is always fighting the dim and light sides of his identity. As per arrangement essayist Caroline Dries, the crowd never truly know his inspirations in view of this exercise in careful control. Dries said this is encapsulated when he undermines Lana into wedding Lex, later uncovering it was to ensure Clark. Glover portrays his off-screen association with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such great science. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are conversing with one another it feels just as he and O'Toole are sharing a discussion, and that trust is envisioned on the camera.
