New York State Route 359 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 359 (NYÃÂ 359) is a state expressway found completely inside the town of Skaneateles in Onondaga County, New York in the United States. At long, it is one of the most brief marked state parkways in all of New York. The course starts at NYÃÂ 38A a half-mile (0.8Ã¢Â km) north of the Onondaga-Cayuga County area line and finishes at NYÃÂ 41A in the villa of Mandana. It lies between Skaneateles Lake and Owasco Lake. Barring its ends, there are just two intersections with different roadways along the whole course. NYÃÂ 359 was alloted in the mid 1940s and was a piece of the first NYÃÂ 26 from 1924 to 1930. 

NYÃÂ 359 starts in the town of Skaneateles at a crossing point with Heifer Street, a neighborhood street, and NYÃÂ 38A. The course goes north, meeting with Weeks Road north of NYÃÂ 38A. Here, NYÃÂ 359 starts to bend toward the east with Weeks Road carrying on the northward arrangement of NYÃÂ 359. After gathering Lacy Road, the course assumes control over its eastÃ¢ÂÂwest steering and heads east. NYÃÂ 359 reaches an end simply under a mile later at NYÃÂ 41A in the lakeside villa of Mandana. East of NYÃÂ 41A, the roadway proceeds for generally to a vessel dispatch on the western shore of Skaneateles Lake, from NYÃÂ 38A. 

Marked as a northÃ¢ÂÂsouth course, it lies that route at the southern end, yet about halfway along its length the street turns and thus ventures eastÃ¢ÂÂwest. Barring its ends, there are just two intersections with different roadways along the whole course. It is the main case in New York of a course assigned without an alphabetic addition that ends at the two closures at suffixed courses. 

The starting points of NYÃÂ 359 go back to the task of the primary state courses in New York in 1924. As of now, all of present day NYÃÂ 359 turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 26, a parkway that proceeded with north along what is currently NYÃÂ 41A toward the town of Skaneateles and south on present day NYÃÂ 38A toward the town of Moravia. In the 1930 renumbering of state thruways in New York, NYÃÂ 26 was reassigned somewhere else in the state. Its previous steering was joined into a few new courses, including some portion of NYÃÂ 38A from Moravia to the cutting edge intersection of NYÃÂ 38A and NYÃÂ 359 and part of NYÃÂ 41A from Mandana to Skaneateles. The segment that is currently NYÃÂ 359, in any case, got no assignment and wound up unnumbered. It was assigned as NYÃÂ 359 in the mid 1940s.
