Celebrated fans 

Maribor's greatest competition was with Olimpija Ljubljana, against whom they challenged the Eternal derby (""). Olimpija collapsed and was broken up in 2005. Today, the continuation of the competition is considered as the matches among Maribor and the new Olimpija Ljubljana, built up in 2005 as NK BeÄºÅ¾igrad. The contention followed its underlying foundations back to the mid 1960s, when the main match between the two clubs was played. The two groups spoke to the two biggest urban communities in Slovenia, the capital city of Ljubljana and the second biggest city Maribor, and the two groups dependably had the biggest fan bases in the nation. Customarily, Ljubljana speaks to the wealthier western piece of the nation, while Maribor is the focal point of the more unfortunate eastern part. What's more, Ljubljana was dependably the social, instructive, financial and political focal point of the nation and Olimpija and its fans were considered as the delegates of the high society. Maribor, then again, was a standout amongst the most industrialized urban communities in Yugoslavia, and most of its fans were the agents of the average workers, which implies that the contention more often than not had political, social, and social pressures also. 

The old competition achieved its top in the last round of the 2000Ã¢ÂÂ01 season, when a standout amongst the most commended matches in Slovenian League history was played. Olimpija met Maribor at their home arena, BeÄºÅ¾igrad, and the two groups were vieing for their fifth Slovenian League title. The home group required a success for the title, while a draw was sufficient for Maribor. The environment was electric days before the commencement, and the arena with a limit of 8,500 was totally sold out. Toward the end, the match finished with a draw (1Ã¢ÂÂ1) and Maribor began to praise their fifth sequential title before 3,000 of their fans that accumulated in Ljubljana that day. 

An extra power to the competition is the way that both Maribor and Olimpija dependably had help on their matches from ultras gatherings, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two gatherings are the biggest in the nation, and it isn't phenomenal that the matches between the two clubs were once in a while hindered by savage conflicts between the two gatherings or with the police. On numerous events, previously or after the matches, the fanatics of the two clubs would likewise get together and battle in the city. One of the most exceedingly bad occurrences, in April 2010 after a match, brought about a cutting of an individual from the Green Dragons who, with a gathering of companions, got into a battle with individuals from the Viole in Ljubljana's railroad station. Be that as it may, until this point in time, there have not been any fatalities in the nation identified with football brutality. 

Since the new Olimpija is bolstered by the greater part of the fanatics of the past Olimpija, including their ultras gathering, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing contention with Maribor's own ultras bunch Viole Maribor, many see the matches among Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the competition and allude to it by a similar name. Nonetheless, there are numerous fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that don't have a similar view and don't have comparative convictions, including some portion of the media, for example, RTV Slovenija and VeÃ¤Âer. The general measurements of the old and the new Olimpija are followed independently by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The principal coordinate among Maribor and the "new" Olimpija occurred on 24 October 2007 out of a Slovenian glass quarter-last match that was won by Maribor, 3Ã¢ÂÂ1. At the time, Olimpija was all the while contending under the name Olimpija BeÄºÅ¾igrad. Factually, Maribor is the more effective club either on account of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the entire time frame from 1962 to introduce day. 

The other competition of the club was that against Mura from Murska Sobota. Like Olimpija, Mura likewise collapsed and was broken down in 2005 and today the continuation of the competition is considered as the matches among Maribor and NÄºÂ  Mura, set up in 2012, who think about themselves, together with the devotees of the old Mura, as the otherworldly continuation of the disintegrated club. The match between the two clubs was first played in 1967 in the season of SFR Yugoslavia. Despite the fact that the principal coordinate was played in the late 1960s it was not until the freedom of Slovenia in 1991 when the majority of the matches were played. Prior to the foundation of the 1. SNL in 1991 the two clubs had never played together in the top division and the contention wound up obvious simply after the freedom of Slovenia, when the two clubs were among the top groups of the recently settled national alliance. Mura originates from a little, provincial town of Murska Sobota in eastern Slovenia which is the focal point of the least fortunate locale in the nation, Prekmurje. Prekmurje was, for around a thousand years, some portion of the Kingdom of Hungary, not at all like other Slovene Lands. It accordingly keeps up certain particular phonetic, social and religious highlights that separate it from other conventional Slovenian areas. The Mura waterway, which keeps running on the fringe between Styria (""), the capital of which is Maribor, and Prekmurje was accordingly a characteristic hindrance, yet political also. Amid the 1990s and mid 2000s the two clubs were the best and mainstream groups in the eastern piece of the nation.
