"The Eleventh Hour" is the principal scene of the fifth arrangement of the British sci-fi TV program "Specialist Who", first communicate on BBC One and BBC HD on 3 April 2010. The scene saw a total change in cast and creation team, it was composed by new head essayist and official maker Steven Moffat and coordinated by Adam Smith. 

In the scene, the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) crashes his reality machine, the TARDIS, into the little English town of Leadworth, where he meets a youthful Scottish young lady named Amelia Pond (Caitlin Blackwood). The Doctor is compelled to leave, yet guarantees Amelia he will return in five minutes. Be that as it may, he arrives twelve years late and is defied by the adult Amelia, presently known as Amy (Karen Gillan), who does not confide in him. He endeavors to pick up her trust to help return the shape-moving outsider Prisoner Zero to the galactic police, the Atraxi, before they obliterate the Earth. 

The scene is the first featuring appearance of Smith as the Doctor and Gillan as his new friend. It likewise presented Arthur Darvill as Amy's sweetheart Rory Williams, who might later turn into a principle cast part. The show's custom is for the Doctor to rest after he recovers, yet Moffat chose to have him spare the world. The scene sets up the primary story bend of the arrangement by presenting the breaks known to mankind. "The Eleventh Hour" was seen by 10.08 million watchers in the UK, the most elevated appraised debut since "Rose". It additionally pulled in ubiquity on the online BBC iPlayer and on BBC America in the United States. The scene got positive audits from faultfinders, who invited Smith and Gillan into the arrangement. 

The recently recovered Eleventh Doctor crash-handles his TARDIS in the English town of Leadworth. The Doctor leaves the TARDIS to self-fix while a youthful Scottish young lady, Amelia Pond, encourages him recoup. She demonstrates to him a split in her room divider that he perceives as a tear in space-time, prompting an Atraxi jail. The Atraxi alert him to the departure of Prisoner Zero. Before he can react, he should take the TARDIS for a short outing to support its fixes, and guarantees Amelia he will return in five minutes. She gathers a bag and sits tight for him. 

The Doctor returns, uninformed twelve years have passed. He is confronted by a more seasoned Amelia, presently known as Amy, who has been scorned by the residents for her interest with her "raggedy Doctor". The Doctor sees an entryway covered up by a recognition channel in Amy's home, and discovers Prisoner Zero inside. They escape before it assaults. The Atraxi touch base in Earth's circle and, talking through all specialized gadgets, request they turn more than Zero or they will demolish the Earth. 

Looking for Zero, who can appear as any oblivious being that it has clairvoyantly connected to, they keep running over Amy's beau Rory, who enables spot To zero acting like one of the trance like state patients in his consideration. The Doctor coordinates Amy and Rory to the emergency clinic, while he door crashes an internet meeting of specialists examining the Atraxi cautioning to give them directions. Amy and Rory corner Zero at the emergency clinic, and the Doctor touches base as the specialists execute his arrangement, broadcasting "zero" to the Atraxi alongside the photographs of the trance like state patients from Rory's telephone, uncovering Zero's character. Zero shows it has one more structure, thumping out Amy and appearing as Amelia. The Doctor addresses Amy's subliminal to compel Zero to take its local structure, enabling the Atraxi to recover it. Zero cautions the Doctor as it is removed "quiet will fall". As the Atraxi leave Earth, the Doctor proclaims that he is Earth's defender and sternly alerts them not to undermine the planet once more. 

The Doctor comes back to the completely fixed TARDIS and leaves without bidding a fond farewell. He rematerialises two years after the fact, and keeping in mind that Amy is still unpleasant over his unique vanishing, she consents to his idea to go with him. As the TARDIS dematerialises, the watcher is demonstrated Amy's room, where her wedding dress falsehoods. 

"The Eleventh Hour", denoted a few creation changes. Steven Moffat succeeded Russell T Davies as official maker and head author. Docks Wenger and Beth Willis supplanted Julie Gardner as official maker. Another logo was joined into another title succession with another variety of the topic tune, created by Murray Gold. Before the finish of "The Eleventh Hour", the Doctor has another sonic screwdriver and the TARDIS donned another inside and outside, like the one utilized from 1963 to 1966. The past TARDIS inside was appeared toward the start of "The Eleventh Hour"; the Time Rotor on the reassure must be revamped because of the touchy embellishments that were utilized in "The End of Time". 

"The End of Time" saw the finish of David Tennant's residency of the Doctor and his recovery into Matt Smith. Moffat was initially hoping to thrown a moderately aged performer, however he and Wenger ran with the 26-year-old Smith in what they thought about a simple choice. Karen Gillan was given a role as the Doctor's new friend Amy Pond; she had recently showed up in the fourth arrangement scene "The Fires of Pompeii" and was proposed to Moffat by throwing chief Andy Pryor. Gillan tried out for the job in both her common Scottish and English articulations. Simply after Gillan was thrown was Amy made Scottish. 

The youthful Amy, known as Amelia, was played by Karen Gillan's genuine cousin Caitlin Blackwood. In spite of the fact that Gillan prescribed Blackwood, the youthful performing artist initially needed to experience thorough tryouts, without any formal acting background. "The Eleventh Hour" was likewise the introduction of Arthur Darvill as Rory Williams, who turned into a normal in the 6th arrangement. Moffat expressed that what emerged about Darvill's tryout was "exactly how amusing" he was. "EastEnders" star Nina Wadia was picked for the piece of the specialist at the Leadworth Hospital. Wadia estimated that she was thrown in light of the fact that she had worked with Adam Smith previously. Patrick Moore shows up as himself in the video meeting with a concise talking part, however not every one of his lines endure the finished product. The man above Moore is the sibling of Adam Smith. Marcello Magni, who played a man Prisoner Zero mimics that barks like his puppy, had just functioned as a canine impersonator. Foundation Award-winning performer Olivia Colman and "The Umbrella Academy" star Tom Hopper show up in little jobs (as one of Prisoner ZeroÃ¢ÂÂs structures, and Jeff, individually). 

The title of the scene is a statement with a double meaning, alluding both to the presentation of the eleventh Doctor and to the way that he was almost past the point of no return, the implication of the expression. In the DVD critique, Moffat said it was initially titled "The Doctor Returns", and that it was the most troublesome content he had ever composed, as he needed to present another Doctor, another buddy, persuade the gathering of people that it was both another and an old show, and convey a quick paced story. While generally the Doctor rests after he recovers, Moffat figured it is enjoyable to make him spare the world. He depicted it as a satire of a man whose day continues deteriorating and more terrible. Trusting that London and friends from London had turned into a clichÄÅ¡ and the group of onlookers had turned out to be exhausted with it, Moffat set the scene in the anecdotal town of Leadworth. Moffat, a Scot, discussed whether to find the scene in a town in Scotland. He at last settled on England, with regards to the idea of Amelia as an unpredictable young lady. 

All through the scene, the Doctor acts whimsically, as he step by step becomes accustomed to his new body and tastes while building up another identity. Willis expressed that he "at long last fits properly" subsequent to selecting his new outfit." The housetop scene was not in the first content; the Doctor basically fled from the ward and came back to the TARDIS. Moffat felt that he didn't generally have a formal presentation, and that more could be made of the ensemble, the same number of past Doctors had chosen unobtrusively. The primary story circular segment is the Doctor getting the developed together Amy. Moffat felt that after some time the connections between the Doctor and his colleagues had turned out to be excessively grown-up. He needed to make a virtuous relationship like that between Peter Pan and Wendy, instead of sweetheart and sweetheart. He trusted this was the sort of relationship watchers had with the Doctor, paying little mind to their age. At the point when the Doctor returns for Amy, she is an altogether different individual from the seven-year-old he had met previously. Moffat clarifies that she built up an extreme component and had turned out to be skeptical and negative because of him not returning as guaranteed, constraining her to acknowledge that he was a nonexistent companion. Rory was totally infatuated with Amy, however Amy needed undertakings before conceding she adored him, as well. Moffat depicted Rory as somebody who had experienced childhood in the shadow of Amy's fanciful Doctor. 

Moffat was enlivened by a break in his child's room divider and formed the thought into the principle story bend for the fifth arrangement. He believed that a youngster may feel that something fascinating lived inside such a break. The shrouded room in Amelia's home depended on Moffat's common youth long for a nonexistent concealed room in his grandma's home. Moffat was quick to give the beast a goliath eyeball, and remarked that the Atraxi's designÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ a mammoth eyeball on a starÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ was simple for youngsters to draw, as he used to draw "Specialist Who" beasts as a tyke. These angles reflect "Specialist Who" "locally scaled hazard" guideline. Moffat composed a scene that clarified Prisoner Zero's wrongdoing, yet cut it since he figured nobody would mind. 

The opening grouping, in which the Doctor scarcely clings to the smashing TARDIS as it flies over London, was later added to the content to connect from the finish of "The End of Time" to the TARDIS's collide with Amy's greenery enclosure. Moffat figured it would be interesting on the off chance that they demonstrated him hanging out of the TARDIS and about colliding with London, which would begin a scene set in a community in a major manner. Moffat additionally referenced the scene from A.A. Milne's "The House at Pooh Corner", where Tigger cases to like everything, except then continues to dismiss all nourishment offered to him until he at last finds that he prefers concentrate of malt. Moffat's variation had the recently recovered Doctor dismiss an assortment of sustenances, except for fish fingers with custard, offered to him by the youthful Amy. Moffat felt that speaking to kids was critical to the show's prosperity. The scene where the Doctor makes the infection utilizing Jeff's workstation was initially set in a homeroom where the Doctor utilized the understudies' PCs; this was changed for creation reasons. In the scene, the Doctor snaps his fingers to open the TARDIS, a trap his past manifestation gained from River Song "Peacefully in the Library"/"Woods of the Dead". He likewise rehashes the lines "wibbley-wobbley, timey-wimey" and "some cattle rustlers in here" from the Moffat-composed scenes "Flicker" and "The Girl in the Fireplace". 

The read-through for the scene occurred in September 2009. In spite of the fact that it is the primary scene of the arrangement, "The Eleventh Hour" was not the first to be shot. It was taped in the third creation obstruct, after the consummation of scenes 2-5. As Smith knew about how his Doctor would act in the accompanying scenes, he utilized this one to set up the character. The arrangement was to hold hints of Smith's forerunner, however the official makers needed Smith to be "more peculiar". The scene was coordinated by Adam Smith, who was pulled in to the "splendid content" and working with Matt Smith in the wake of seeing him in front of an audience. Smith was approached to coordinate "the equivalent yet make it a bit differentÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ the makers didn't need it to be drastically unique, however they wanted it to appear as something else". The objective was to make it progressively "true to life" and mystical, and Smith took motivation from "E.T." and Tim Burton's work. 

Amelia's home was intended to seem "creepy yet common" and reminiscent of a manor. Most scenes situated in Leadworth were recorded in Llandaff town in Cardiff on 29 September, 5Ã¢ÂÂ7 October, and 20 November 2009. Photos were taken on 5 October for the stop-outline liveliness succession speaking to the Doctor's point of view. As the stills were taken by individuals from the team and not PCs the outcome was not immaculate, which Adam Smith thought gave a "natural" feel. Tormented by heavy downpour, the team returned on 20 November to shoot the last Leadworth scenes. The generation team intensely dressed the zone, including blooms, road signs and gifts explicit to Leadworth. 

The Doctor hanging out of the TARDIS was shot with Smith before a greenscreen, while the flying film of London was accomplished with a helicopter. Smith expressed that the scene was difficult to imagine as it depended intensely on PC created pictures. Almost every scene in the arrangement is a special visualizations shot, including a 3-D TARDIS flying over London and a CG Doctor hanging out of the TARDIS in the flying shots. Moffat understood that the Millennium Dome was noticeable in the last film, thus the scene couldn't be set in 1996 preceding it had been fabricated. Rather than a reshoot, Moffat clarified that the TARDIS could be going to return in time and emerge in Amelia's patio nursery. In after generation, 30 tracks of audio cues, music made by Murray Gold explicitly for the arrangement, and Smith's "snorting and moaning" were included. The essentially music-drove succession was created by Nikki Wilson, who gets an "extraordinary much appreciated" credit. 

While Amelia hangs tight for the Doctor in the greenhouse, the camera comes back to her home where something, apparently Prisoner Zero, shoots past the camera. It is really Smith in film planned for the finale, "The Big Bang", yet when it didn't fit into that scene it was reused here. Initially the scene where the Doctor affirms that he is the man she recollects by demonstrating her the apple she allowed him that day was sliced because of pacing issues and that the reality had been built up in a past scene. The past scene was then cut and the apple scene returned. Because of the downpour, the scene where the Doctor attempts to pick up the Atraxi's consideration with his sonic screwdriver must be improved. Adam Smith based the style of the encounter on a Western film. The devastation of the sonic screwdriver soon after was accomplished with a flash impact covered inside the screwdriver, enacted by an electrical charge that achieved the screwdriver by an electrical wire that kept running at Smith's disposal and associated with a beneficiary. Enhancements head Danny Hargreaves at that point utilized a remote control to initiate the gadget. In spite of reports, the impact did not harm Smith. The "fish fingers and custard" scene was shot in 12 takes. The fish fingers were really a breaded coconut-enhanced nourishment thing; Smith assessed that he had eaten exactly 14 of them.
