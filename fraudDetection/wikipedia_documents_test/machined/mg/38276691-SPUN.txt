His forceful barrier against his pundits was contrasted with a comparable strategy found in Conrad Black's diary, "A Matter of Principle", which was discharged just a couple of months prior. Notwithstanding being known as a "tell-all journal", the book was additionally depicted "as much an epitaph as a narrative", an "inventoried defence...[or] separating shot" and like a "journal of a war zone general". With respect to title, a scriptural reference to the Tower of Babel, one analyst trusted it to "allude to Stursberg's perspective on [CBC] as the spot that business presence of mind overlooked" while another commentator thought it "reflect[ed] the warring dialects spoken by the creator and his depreciators"

Not exclusively is this the main record of a wild time inside the institutionÃ¢ÂÂhistory composed by an incomplete victorÃ¢ÂÂbut a few components of its remedy may help reestablish the open telecaster to wellbeing. Specifically, Stursberg's examination of the "threatening toxic acquaintances" on the universal media scene merits consideration."

This is carefully the Gospel According to Richard - engaging yet in addition unmitigatedly self-serving. ... He had no hunger for trade off, agreement or placation. He appeared to savor the opportunity to stun individuals, make them irate and make emotional standoffs. Presently with this book, he catches the opportunity to assault the individuals who remained in his manner." Knelman found the best parts were "where he pursues his apparent foes with an ax", while Newman found "the volume's most wrecking profile [to be] that of CBC president Hubert Lacroix".

Be that as it may, he's right that there is something truly shocking about CBC's hand-wringing about where it goes."
