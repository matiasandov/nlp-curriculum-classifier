The 112th Boat Race occurred on 26 March 1966. Held yearly, the occasion is a one next to the other paddling race between groups from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. The race was won by Oxford by three-and-three-quarter-lengths. Isis won the hold race while Cambridge won the Women's Boat Race. 

The Boat Race is a one next to the other paddling rivalry between the University of Oxford (some of the time alluded to as the "Dull Blues") and the University of Cambridge (now and then alluded to as the "Light Blues"). The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has occurred on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The contention is a noteworthy purpose of respect between the two colleges, pursued all through the United Kingdom and communicate around the world. Oxford went into the race as dominant heroes, having won the earlier year's race by three-and-three-quarter lengths. Cambridge, be that as it may, held the general lead with 61 triumphs to Oxford's 49 (barring the "dead warmth" of 1877). 

The main Women's Boat Race occurred in 1927, yet did not turn into a yearly apparatus until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the challenge was led as a feature of the Henley Boat Races, however as of the 2015 race, it is hung on the River Thames, on a similar day as the men's principle and hold races. The hold race, challenged between Oxford's Isis vessel and Cambridge's Goldie pontoon has been held since 1965. It more often than not happens on the Tideway, preceding the fundamental Boat Race. 

Two days before the fundamental race and in nasty climate, the Cambridge pontoon started to sink and was pushed into freight boats and pulls secured beneath Beverley Brook. The group were saved and as per their vessel club president Mike Sweeney, the occurrence would have no effect on the Light Blues: "we will simply get into our other pontoon and race in that". It was the primary Boat Race vessel to sink since the 1951 race. The Light Blues would push in almost the same situation in which they won the 1962 and 1964 races, while Oxford's specialty was produced by Swiss firm StÄÂ¤mpfli Racing Boats. The two vessels were German-fixed, where the number four and five column on the bow side. The nasty climate proceeded until the day of the race, with further interruption anticipated and the risk of delay a genuine one. The race was umpired by the previous Cambridge University Boat Club president and rower Alan Burrough who partook in Cambridge's triumph in the 1939 race. 

The Cambridge team were trained by D. C. Christie (who paddled for Cambridge in the 1958 and 1959 races), J. G. P. Crowden (who won Blues in the 1951 and the 1952 races), D. M. Jennens (who paddled multiple times somewhere in the range of 1949 and 1951) and I. W. Welsh (who took an interest in the 1956 race). Oxford's mentor was Ronnie Howard who had paddled for the Dark Blues in the 1957 and 1959 races. 

The Cambridge group gauged a normal of 13Ã¢Â st 7Ã¢Â lb (85.5Ã¢Â kg), per rower more than their adversaries. Oxonians Chris and Richard Freeman turned into the primary siblings to push in the Boat Race since 1935 race. The Oxford group contained a solitary previous Blue, the pontoon club president and number two Duncan Clegg, while Cambridge saw Rodney Ward and stroke Mike Sweeeny return. Oxford's P. G. Tuke was following in the strides of his extraordinary granddad F. E. Tuke who had paddled in the 1845 race. There were three non-British members in the race, the Oxford cox Jim Rogers, and Cambridge rowers J. H. Ashby and P. H. Conze were all American. 

Oxford won the hurl and chose to begin from the Surrey station. Regardless of the forecast of poor climate and the danger of delay, the race initiated at the arranged time of 4.15pm. Oxford made the better begin and were a large portion of a-length up on Cambridge, yet with the benefit of the Middlesex twist, the Light Blues were one moment behind at the Mile Post. Oxford responded to a Cambridge push at Harrods Furniture Depository to keep up the lead which they reached out to two seconds by Hammersmith Bridge. The Dark Blues kept on containing Cambridge's endeavors to lessen the deficiency and by Chiswick Steps had clear water with a three-second favorable position. Pushing without end by and by, and with a two-length lead, Oxford's cox Jim Rogers controlled them over the Cambridge vessel to the Middlesex side, and were ten seconds ahead at Barnes Bridge. Oxford won by three-and-three-quarter lengths in a period of 19 minutes 12 seconds. 

In the save race, and after a bogus begin, Oxford's Isis beat Cambridge's Goldie by seventh lengths, their second sequential triumph, in a period of 19 minutes 22 seconds. In the 21st running of the Women's Boat Race, Cambridge triumphed, their fourth back to back triumph.
