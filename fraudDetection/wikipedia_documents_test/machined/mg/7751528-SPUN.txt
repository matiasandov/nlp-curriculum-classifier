MalmÄÅ FF's top managerial staff started the look for another arena in the mid-1990s. MalmÄÅ Stadion, where MalmÄÅ FF had played since its development in 1958, was beginning to break down at this point, and was likewise unreasonably vast for the club, which regularly attempted to fill it for Allsvenskan matches. In 1995, club director Bengt Madsen started to fund-raise for the redesign of MalmÄÅ IP, the club's previous home somewhere in the range of 1910 and 1957, into a cutting edge football arena. MalmÄÅ IP was down to earth and efficient for the club as it was at that point a surviving site, and was littler than MalmÄÅ Stadion, which was costly to keep up. The redesign of MalmÄÅ IP was done in August 1999, and MalmÄÅ FF moved in before long. Be that as it may, the redesigned ground neglected to satisfy desires, ended up being extremely essential by present day guidelines; the negligible limit of 7,600 was likewise considered a security issue.
