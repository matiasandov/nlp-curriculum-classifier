Conrad I of Salzburg 

Conrad I [of Abenberg] (, c. 1075 Ã¢ÂÂ 9 April 1147) was Archbishop of Salzburg, Austria, in the primary portion of the twelfth century. 

Naturally introduced to the Abenberg-Frensdorf honorability, Conrad was raised for an administrative vocation at the court of Emperor Henry IV, where he was an individual from the court house of prayer. He turned into an ordinance in Hildesheim. In the wake of escorting Emperor Henry V in July 1110, Conrad agreed with the Pope in the Investiture Controversy, which in the end prompted his outcast for quite a long while. He came back to Salzburg in 1121 and assumed a vital job in the major political occasions of the day, including the race of Lothair of Supplinburg as King of Germany in 1125 and the ecclesiastical break of 1130 in which he assumed a job in the acknowledgment of Pope Innocent II by the lord. 

Amid the nonattendance of Lothair of Supplinburg in Italy, Conrad was appointed as the ecclesiastical overseer of Salzburg on 4 June 1133. As a sovereign diocesan, he was persuasive in German governmental issues and was a very lively reformer who is frequently called "the second originator of the Church of Salzburg." He managed a get together that administered the issues of the religious houses, kept up solid power over tithes, and was in charge of structure Salzburg Cathedral and the graveyard in 1140. Conrad likewise managed the development of various different cloisters and the strongholds of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach. 

Conrad of Abenberg originated from the group of the Counts of Abenberg-Frensdorf, and had many recognized relatives in Germany. He was conceived around 1075, child of Count Wolfram I von Abenberg. His mom was most likely the girl of Heinrich I, viscount of Regensburg. Conrad had two more established siblings, Otto and Wolfram. He was raised for an administrative profession at the court of the Emperor Henry IV, where he was an individual from the court house of prayer. He turned into a group in Hildesheim. 

Conrad appears to have been included when Henry V rebelled against his dad in 1105. This would clarify his decision as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. Around then the counter Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was introduced in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg joined by his siblings, the tallies Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 officers. A portion of these officers may well have been "servitors", servile as opposed to free vassals. With this showcase of power, he had the capacity to constrain Berthold to resign. Pope Paschal II blessed him as minister on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium. 

In July 1110, Conrad went with Emperor Henry V to Italy. Conrad expedited a solid military escort this visit. Be that as it may, Conrad agreed with the Pope in the Investiture Controversy. 

Because of further clashes with supreme authorities, Conrad needed to escape in 1112 and was not ready to come back to Salzburg until 1121. While in a state of banishment, he lived in Tuscany, Admont in Styria, and Saxony. 

Conrad assumed an imperative job in the major political occasions of the day, including the race of Lothair of Supplinburg as King of Germany in 1125, whom he upheld amid the battle against the Hohenstaufen usurpation. Amid the ecclesiastical faction of 1130 he assumed a job in the acknowledgment of Pope Innocent II by the lord. 

After this, pressures ascended among Conrad and Lothair because of veering sees on chapel governmental issues. Lothair visited Italy in 1132-33, and was delegated ruler by Innocent II on 4 June 1133. In his nonappearance, Conrad was appointed a diocese supervisor. This legitimately encroached on the sovereign's correct, as of late affirmed by the Pope, to contribute a religious administrator with his formal attire before he was appointed. It earned a stern reprimand from Lothair. 

At the point when Lothair kicked the bucket, Conrad at first opposed the decision of the Hohenstaufen Conrad III and upheld Henry X, Duke of Bavaria. Conrad later came round to help the ruler. 

On his arrival from outcast in 1121 or 1122, Conrad discovered his see "poor and incredibly crushed." Conrad worked with notables, for example, Hartmann von Brixen and Gerhoh von Reichersberg to change the ministry in his archdiocese. 

Specifically, he embraced a noteworthy change of the house of prayer pastorate. 

Conrad directed a get together that regulated the undertakings of the religious houses, including the church, and utilized the groups to help control his assets. 

He kept up solid command over tithes, dispensing them between the religious communities and ward ministers to stay away from arguments about their dissemination. Amid his organization, priests of servile starting point relentlessly picked up in status, presently called "ministerialis" instead of "servitor". 

Somewhere in the range of 1125 and 1130, he started printing coins at Friesach, which helped support his activities. This served to change money. Thusly, he roused the King of Hungary, Andrew II, to start his very own printing focuses. 

Conrad reconstructed and extended Salzburg Cathedral and constructed the church part house, and in 1140 he made the basilica burial ground. He manufactured emergency clinics for the poor of the city, and initiated development of St. Subside's religious community where his previous habitation stood, moving to another diocese supervisor's home closer the church building. Conrad established a few religious communities and improved others, a sum of 17 in which the standard of the Augustinian Canons Regular won. These included St. Zeno, Gurk, Reichersberg, Berchtesgaden, Baumburg, Gars am Inn, Au am Inn, Ranshofen, HÄÅglwÄÅrth, Herrenchiemsee, Seckau and Suben. The diocese supervisor upheld the Benedictines. 

Amid his outcast, Duke Henry III of Eppenstein, sibling of Ulrich I, patriarch of Aquileia (r. 1086Ã¢ÂÂ1121), had caught property having a place with the Salzburg see in Friuli and Carinthia. Conrad banished him and sent a power of 1,000 warriors to Carinthia, constraining the duke to restore the properties. 

Afterward, Conrad achieved an understanding of "harmony and companionship" ("pax et amicitia") with the Patriarch Pellegrino I of Aquileia (r. 1130Ã¢ÂÂ1161) whereby he consented to pay tithes to Aquileia for those properties which the archdiocese held in the patriarchate. Conrad's precedent was trailed by promises to pay their tithes from the others present when the understanding was come to. 

Conrad finished development of the strongholds of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach, which Archbishop Gebhard had begun to work in 1077. In Styria, he transformed the military association and organization of chapel properties, and manufactured solid strongholds. For barrier against Hungary, he manufactured fortresses at Leibnitz (Seggau) and Pettau (Ptuj), and Brestanica stronghold. He likewise extended the Burg Deutschlandsberg manor at the focal point of the Salzburg assets in western Styria. In 1131, he made harmony with King BÄÅ¡la II of Hungary, which was trailed by an extensive stretch of solidness in the outskirt area. 

Conrad kicked the bucket on 9 April 1147 in Lungau, Salzburg. A mysterious history, known as the "Vita Chuonradi archiepiscopi Salisburgensis", was made during the 1170s. It depicts Conrad as a man of harmony. His job in the regal races of 1125 and 1138 spot him among the main German Prince-religious administrators in the High Middle Ages. He earned the title of "second originator of the Salzburg church."
