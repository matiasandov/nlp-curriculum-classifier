Imagined as a bizarre mix of a substantial church surmounted by an inn, development of the structure brought building debate. At first structured by Timothy L. Pflueger in the Gothic Revival style, the speculators terminated his firm and procured Lewis P. Hobart, who changed little of Pflueger's plan. In a subsequent claim, Pflueger won about a large portion of the harms he requested. The structure opened in 1930 as the William Taylor Hotel and Temple Methodist Episcopal Church. In any case, additional development costs had put the assembly at more prominent monetary hazard, and the congregation lodging idea did not demonstrate prevalent. No benefit was made in six years, and the congregation left, losing their speculation. In the late 1930s the structure housed the Empire Hotel, known for its Sky Room relax, at that point from World War II to the 1970s, 100 McAllister filled in as U.S. government workplaces. 

Reviving as college lodging and workplaces in 1981, McAllister Tower is home to approximately 300 law understudies and their families. "The Tower" is sited one square from the managerial and educational focus of Hastings College of the Law, and is the most conspicuous structure in the locale. 

The high rise at 100 McAllister started in 1920 with an arrangement figured by Reverend Walter John Sherman to blend four of the biggest Methodist Episcopal assemblies in San Francisco, sell their different holy places and properties and consolidate their advantages for manufacture a "superchurch" with a lodging over it. From their underlying $800,000 they purchased property at McAllister and Leavenworth lanes and contracted the engineering firm of Miller and Pflueger to structure the building. Timothy L. Pflueger was picked as the originator. The new lodging, proposed to be "dry" (serving no mixed refreshments) in the "evil" city, was to be named after William Taylor, a Methodist Episcopal road minister and preacher who framed the principal Methodist church in San Francisco. The huge church was named Temple Methodist Episcopal Church, or just "Sanctuary Methodist". 

Starting in 1925, Pflueger structured a , 28-story, venture back high rise made of block surrounded with steel, along the lines of his simply finished Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company Building. Its primary improving topic was neo-Gothic, communicated unequivocally in the three Gothic curves which framed the principle road level passage for the congregation. The Great Hall, the expansive love region situated inside the second, third and fourth floors was to situate 1,500 churchgoers and a littler house of prayer was intended for 125 more. A great pipe organ from Skinner Organ Company was introduced with four manuals controlling 3,881 funnels. A recolored glass window was set 80 feet over the haven, speaking to Faith, Love and Hope in three tall, slender boards. Two get together lobbies could be joined to hold 1,100 participants for showy or athletic occasions. Somewhere in the range of 500 visitor rooms and 32 tower lofts were planned to bring a consistent progression of guests and a wellspring of benefit to the congregation. In spite of the fact that never the tallest structure in San Francisco, it was to be the tallest inn on the Pacific Coast for a long time. 

In a debate, the compositional firm of Miller and Pflueger was terminated from the undertaking, and was supplanted by Lewis P. Hobart. Mill operator and Pflueger sued for $81,600, claiming that Hobart's plan was minimal transformed from Pflueger's unique. A quarter of a year after the lodging and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in a good court choice. 

Devotion of the congregation's pipe organ occurred August 31, 1930. It was E. M. Skinner's creation 819 of Boston Mass. <https://pipeorgandatabase.org/OrganDetails.php?OrganID=23624> The joined assemblage was happy with their new residence of love. 

In the long run costing ($Ã¢Â million in current esteem), the structure's fulfillment required a few rounds of new financing from its speculators so as to conquer unforeseen costs. Sadly for the assemblage, the possibility of a lodging over a congregation didn't pull in the essential number of visitors and the endeavor neglected to turn a benefit. 

From 1990 through 2001, the congregation housed the venue of George Coates Performance Works Ã¢ÂÂ an exploratory multi-media theater troupe that used the 60 foot high vaulted roof for projections. 

By November 1936, enough obligation had aggregated that a bondholder's defensive council abandoned the property, repurchasing it for $750,000. The Temple Methodist assemblage lost its venture and was approached to leave. The Skinner Opus pipe organ was evacuated to be sold to Occidental College in Los Angeles and modified in their Thorne Hall. The three-piece recolored glass window was evacuated and displayed, in the long run advancing toward Stockton, California where it was introduced in the Morris Chapel at the University of the Pacific. The 100 McAllister building itself was renovated: the congregation's floor territory was offered over to stopping, a coffeehouse was worked in part of the main floor entryway and the new endeavor opened again as the Empire Hotel, noted for finishing, in 1938, the principal see relax in the zone, the Sky Room on the 24th floor. With rich covering, a huge Art Deco-style oval bar, and reinforced glass windows on all sides, the Sky Room gave an all encompassing perspective on the city. "Planner and Engineer" composed of the extravagant bar in April, 1938, that it "has no model west of New York", alluding to Manhattan's Rainbow Room which opened three-and-a-half years sooner. 

Toward the start of direct American inclusion in World War II, the U.S. government purchased the structure and changed over it to administrative workplaces, officer billets, spaces utilized by the Army's Ordnance Procurement office, a visa office and an enlistment focus kept running by the nearby draft board. The high vaulted roof of the Great Hall love focus was covered up by a dropped roof. After the war, the Internal Revenue Service moved workplaces into the structure. 

Numerous government bunches at 100 McAllister moved their workplaces in 1959Ã¢ÂÂ1960 to the recently assembled administrative structure at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, later named the Phillip Burton Federal Building. Inhabitance at 100 McAllister was low, however the United States Army Corps of Engineers moved their San Francisco District workplaces there during the 1960s, and neighborhood draftees were as yet required to show up there through the late 1960s. The San Francisco Selective Service System workplaces were situated in the lower floors of the structure amid the Vietnam War. 

In 1978, the University of California, Hastings College of the Law purchased the structure, the most conspicuous in the Tenderloin locale, and started two years of restoration and update. Calling it "McAllister Tower", 248 units were modernized for private use by law understudies, and the structure opened in 1981 with a blend of minimal studio units just as bigger one-and two-room condos taking up a sum of 17 stories. The structure, home to around 300 law understudies and their families, is coolly alluded to as "the Tower" by Hastings inhabitants and staff, who have however a one-square drive to the graduate school's principle working at 200 McAllister. 

The old Sky Room with its awesome 360-degree see revived in 1999 as the James Edgar Hervey Skyroom, out of appreciation for former student James Edgar Hervey, Class of 1950, a noticeable San Diego preliminary legal counselor.
