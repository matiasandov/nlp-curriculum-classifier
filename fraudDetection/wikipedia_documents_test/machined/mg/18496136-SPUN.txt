Beth Israel Congregation (Jackson, Mississippi) 

Beth Israel Congregation () is a Reform Jewish assembly situated at 5315 Old Canton Road in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. Sorted out in 1860 by Jews of German foundation, it has dependably been, and remains, the main Jewish synagogue in Jackson. Beth Israel manufactured the main synagogue in Mississippi in 1867, and, after it burned to the ground, its 1874 substitution was at one time the most established religious structure in Jackson. 

Initially Orthodox, the gathering joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1874. In the wake of experiencing a progression of rabbis, and periods without one, the gathering contracted Meyer Lovitt as rabbi in 1929; he would stay until 1954. The gathering moved to another structure in 1941. 

Dr. Perry Nussbaum, Beth Israel's rabbi from 1954 to 1973, was dynamic in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1967 the assemblage moved to another synagogue constructing, (its present one), and both the new structure and Nussbaum's home were shelled by the Ku Klux Klan that year. In 2003, Valerie Cohen turned into the assemblage's first female rabbi. 

, the rabbi was Jeffrey Kurtz-Lendner. With a developing enrollment of more than 200 families, Beth Israel was the biggest Jewish assemblage in the state. 

The gathering was initially settled in 1860 by [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jews of German background]]. Its main role was to make a Jewish graveyard, which it quickly did, on State Street. In November 1862 the assemblage employed a Mr. Oberndorfer as [[hazzan|cantor]]; its next objective was give Jewish training to the assemblage's youngsters. At the time Jackson had 15 Jewish families. 

Various records express that the assembly's first synagogue was worked at South State and South lanes in 1861 and consumed by the [[Union Army]] in 1863, however the veracity of the last case is questioned. That year the gathering had 31 individuals, and embraced its first constitution. In 1867 the assemblage developed a wood [[Framing (construction)|frame]] working at the edge of South State and South roads. The structure, which was utilized both as a school building and for [[Jewish services|prayer services]], was the first [[synagogue]] in Mississippi. 

From the begin the assembly was not brought together. Be that as it may, as there were just around 50 Jews in Jackson in 1868, the network was unreasonably little for two synagogues. Clashes emerged between the more seasoned German Jewish individuals and post-[[American Civil War]] [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish workers from Poland]], especially over synagogue custom. The synagogue pursued the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] "[[Nusach#Nusach Ashkenaz|nusach Ashkenaz]]", however a few individuals needed to receive [[Isaac Mayer Wise]]'s reformist "[[Minhag America]]" Prayer-Book. 

Strains facilitated when Beth Israel contracted its first Rabbi, the Reverend L. Winter, in 1870. He moved the assembly towards Reform Judaism, supplanting Saturday administrations with Friday night ones, giving lessons in English, and including [[Confirmation#Judaism|confirmation ceremonies]]. Winter, be that as it may, left soon a short time later. 

Beth Israel's structure torched in July 1874, and was supplanted by a stone and block working at a similar area. Devoted in 1875, the two-story block [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] structure had "[[Ogive#Architecture|pointed-arch]] windows", and an assembly room on the second floor that was gotten to by means of two bended staircases. The planner, Joseph Willis, had recently structured or renovated a few noteworthy structures in Mississippi, including the [[Old Mississippi State Capitol]]. In later years one straight staircase supplanted the two bended ones, and the uncovered block dividers were secured by [[stucco]]. 

In 1875, Beth Israel likewise formalized its turn to Reform by joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (presently [[Union for Reform Judaism]]). 

Following its establishing the assembly became all around gradually; by 1908 there were still just 37 individuals, and 16 kids in the religious school. By 1918, enrollment had tumbled to 24, and kids in the religious school to 10. That year the synagogue's absolute pay was $800 (today $). 

In the main many years of the twentieth century, the area around the South State Street building progressed to modern use. To suit individuals who had moved far from Jackson's downtown, in 1940 the assembly started development of another structure at 546 East Woodrow Wilson Avenue (west of State Street), while holding administrations at Galloway Memorial Methodist Church. The assemblage moved into the new structure in 1941, and devoted it in January 1942. The asylum had strong walnut [[pew]]s that sat 300. Beth Israel's old structure at South State and South roads was pulverized; at the season of the move, it was the most seasoned structure utilized for religious purposes in Jackson. In 2005, a chronicled marker was put at the area by the State of Mississippi, remembering the first Beth Israel synagogue structures. 

In its initial couple of decades Beth Israel experienced various rabbis, whose residencies were all fleeting, and persevered through numerous periods with no rabbi by any stretch of the imagination. One rabbi, Louis Schreiber, was procured in 1915, and terminated the following year, for "horribly annoying and offending  of Beth Israel individuals". In 1929 the assembly enlisted Meyer Lovitt as rabbi, and with him Beth Israel accomplished a proportion of security. By 1939, the synagogue had 72 individuals, out of an all out Jewish populace in Jackson of around 250. 

Lovitt was non-fierce, and abstained from getting associated with issues identifying with the [[civil rights movement]]. He limited the contrasts among Christianity and Judaism, and saw absorption decidedly. He favored that the gathering commend the [[Jewish holidays]] in manners that pulled in no consideration, and had no protest to individuals setting up Christmas trees, which he alluded to as "[[Hanukkah bush]]es." Lovitt would stay with Beth Israel until his retirement in 1954. 

In 1954, Lovitt was prevailing by Dr. Perry Nussbaum. Conceived in [[Toronto]] in 1908 and raised there, Nussbaum had gone to a little [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue as a kid, and, after secondary school, functioned as secretary for the [[Holy Blossom Temple]]'s rabbi Barnett R. Brickner. With consolation from Brickner, in 1926 he connected and was acknowledged into a joined eight-year rabbinic appointment and degree program at [[Hebrew Union College]] in Cincinnati and [[University of Cincinnati]]. He graduated in 1933, Hebrew Union College's first Canadian alumni. He was the last individual from his class to get an idea of a position, so he needed to acknowledge as his first rabbinic posting a job at a Reform synagogue in Melbourne. This did not work out, as he was excessively unpracticed. Nussbaum therefore served at a synagogue in [[Amarillo, Texas]], and in 1937 acknowledged a situation as a jail clergyman in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], where he additionally filled in as low maintenance custodian at the nearby college, and showed open talking. In 1941 he progressed toward becoming rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in [[Wichita, Kansas]], and in 1943 he joined the [[Chaplain Corps (United States Army)|Chaplain Corps of the United States Army]]. He served in the [[Philippines]], and inevitably turned into a [[colonel]] in the [[United States Army Reserve]]. 

After the war, he was partner rabbi at a synagogue in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] (a position a few different rabbis had rejected). Finding that the rabbi there needed a secretary, not a right hand, Nussbaum surrendered after not exactly a year, and moved to Temple Emanu-el of [[Long Beach, New York]]. He found the situation there amazingly political, and following three years moved toward becoming rabbi of [[Temple Anshe Amunim (Pittsfield, Massachusetts)|Temple Anshe Amunim]] in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]. After Lovitt resigned from Beth Israel, the seat of the Central Conference of American Rabbis (and previous schoolmate and companion), Rabbi Nathan Perilman, prescribed the post to Nussbaum. Perilman expressed the gathering was superb, and would regard and welcome him. He likewise praised the city of Jackson. Searching for strength, and some "rest and unwinding", Nussbaum met for the job; the hunt council's first inquiry to him was "Specialist, what's your situation on [[school desegregation]]?" He answered that he was a liberal, yet was mindful so as not to cause his gatherers harm. In spite of the fact that the board was worried about his progressivism, they offered him the job, which he acknowledged, leaving from Temple Anshe Anusim. 

Nussbaum had a mighty identity, and was blunt and not especially prudent; a few devotees recalled that him decades after he resigned as "resolute" and "rough". He was a decent teacher, speaker, and minister, and had a specific talent for forming unique supplications. Nussbaum discovered Beth Israel's participation exceedingly acclimatized, and, in his view, a few gatherers were "hostile to Hebrew, against Israel, hostile to everything!" He scrutinized individuals who set up Christmas trees (an expansive extent did), and gradually re-presented Jewish ceremonies, for example, [[bar mitzvah]]s to the assembly's training. He additionally built up a yearly instructive program for grown-ups, and included Hebrew examinations. 

Nussbaum bolstered [[Zionism]] and [[Israel]], causes which his gatherers normally freely evaded. After landing at Beth Israel he found that a portion of his most extravagant individuals were supporters of the counter Zionist [[American Council for Judaism]], and he promptly precluded them from gathering in the synagogue's premises, which, as per Nussbaum, "left its scars". He transparently proclaimed that Judaism was a religion particular from Christianity, as opposed to only a [[Old Testament]] form of it. In 1955, Nussbaum composed the Mississippi Assembly of Jewish Congregations, which had agents from every one of the twenty-five of Mississippi's synagogues, and was chosen its leader. He was constantly enthusiastic about ecumenical work, however found that rabbis were avoided from the Jackson Ministerial Association, which was Protestant-as it were. He rather helped found the Jackson Interfaith Fellowship. 

Following the [[bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple]] in 1958, Nussbaum composed an article in Beth Israel's notice titled "It Can Happen Here", in which he communicated the view that such a besieging was very conceivable in Jackson. A duplicate of the article was republished in Jackson's common press, and raised significant resistance among Jackson's authority. This thusly prompted Nussbaum's first fight with his assemblage; at the following executive gathering it was suggested that Nussbaum be required to clear all open articulations with the board before making them. The rabbi's supporters had the capacity to overcome the goals, however the endeavor shook Nussbaum, however he didn't end his activism. In 1961 Nussbaum gave impressive help to the early [[Freedom Riders]] detained in Mississippi prisons, and in 1966 Nussbaum started supporting yearly "Church Institutes" at Beth Israel, to which he welcomed nearby dark priests. 

As pressures in the [[Southern United States]] increased over the [[civil rights movement]], the Jews of Jackson went under risk, being focused by both the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) and the Americans for the Preservation of the White Race (APWR). The last set up a corner at Jackson's state reasonable selling anti-Jewish writing, and [[Samuel Bowers]], the KKK's Imperial Wizard in Mississippi, requested assaults on both the synagogue and Nussbaum. The situation of Beth Israel's enrollment in Jackson was not verify; as per Murray Polner, writing in 1977, "Judaism may rank higher in the ethical request of the Bible Belt fundamentalists than, state, Black Christianity or Roman Catholicism, yet it stays in any case a lessÃ¢ÂÂthanÃ¢ÂÂequal faction, and superfluous and outside religion in a territory of xenophobes." Jews were informally prohibited from participation in the Jackson Country Club, and the devotees were utilized to "standard insults and outrages" from Jackson's prevailing white fervent Protestant people group. 

In 1967, the gathering moved to its present area, a structure on Old Canton Road depicted by [[Jack Nelson (journalist)|Jack Nelson]] as "an octagonal structure overwhelmed by an enormous rooftop". At the devotion in March of that year, both highly contrasting priests took an interest. On September 18, 1967 the new structure was destroyed by an explosive bomb put by Klan individuals in a recessed entryway. As per Nelson, the blast had "tore through managerial workplaces and a gathering room, torn an opening in the roof, extinguished windows, cracked a water pipe and clasped a divider." The bomb caused $25,000 (today $) worth of harm. 

After three days the Greater Jackson Clergy Alliance "communicated their distress and backing for the Jewish people group" by sorting out a "Stroll of Penance". The Alliance, which had been framed two months sooner, contained 60 ministry from 10 groups, "the primary racially coordinated relationship of Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in Mississippi." Nussbaum had helped thought that it was, converging into it the Jackson Interfaith Fellowship. The Reverend Thomas Tiller, the Alliance president, expressed that "as a matter of course, we may have added to an atmosphere of assessment which offers ascend to fear based oppression. What concerns us, and others like us, is that we might not have been sufficiently ardent in securing our natural opportunities." Despite this show of solidarity, and a reward offered of a few thousand dollars, the culprits were not found. 

In November of that year a similar gathering planted a bomb that smothered the front of Nussbaum's home, while he and his significant other were resting there. Nussbaum accused the bombings for neighborhood [[antisemitism]] and extremism, however a large portion of his assemblage accused Nussbaum's enemy of [[Racial isolation in the United States|segregationist]] activism. In spite of the fact that the assembly authoritatively bolstered him, various individuals secretly encouraged him to leave Beth Israel and discover another podium. The synagogue's leading body of trustees casted a ballot to deny non-Jewish gatherings from utilizing the synagogue's premises except if they had earlier endorsement from the board; the aim was to put a conclusion to the interracial gatherings that Nussbaum held there. 

In the wake of the bombings, Nussbaum needed to leave Jackson, yet as a 60-year-old rabbi was unfit to discover another posting. He remained at Beth Israel until his retirement in 1973, when he and his significant other moved to [[San Diego]]. 

After Nussbaum's retirement, Beth Israel employed Richard Birnholz as rabbi. Birnholz was appointed at Hebrew Union College in 1971, and had served from 1971 to 1973 as associate rabbi of [[Temple Israel (Memphis, Tennessee)|Temple Israel]] in Memphis, Tennessee. While filling in as rabbi, he was additionally a meeting teacher in [[Millsaps College]]'s religion division. In 1977, he won the Samuel Kaminker Memorial Award for his casual instruction educational modules, and in 1983 he was graduated class in-living arrangement at Hebrew Union College in New York. He served Beth Israel until 1986, at that point moved to Congregation Schaarai Zedek in [[Tampa, Florida]]. 

Birnholz was trailed by Eric Gurvis, Steven Engel, and Jim Egolf, every one of whom, as Nussbaum before them, likewise filled in as the rabbis of Temple Beth El in [[Lexington, Mississippi]], driving administrations there once per month on Sunday. Toward the finish of the twentieth century, Beth Israel was the biggest of the fourteen synagogues in Mississippi, with 213 part families. 

In 2003, Beth Israel contracted Valerie Cohen, Beth Israel's first female rabbi. Cohen had initially earned a B.A. in [[public relations]], at that point learned at [[Hebrew Union College]]'s Israel, Cincinnati and New York City grounds. She graduated in 1999 and was appointed at [[Manhattan]]'s [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Temple Emanuel]]. In the wake of serving for a long time as right hand rabbi at Temple Israel in Memphis, Tennessee, Cohen joined Beth Israel. She proceeded with the custom of her ancestors of additionally filling in as the rabbi of Lexington's Temple Beth El. 

In 2005 Cohen began classes for grown-ups who wished to praise their [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]], however had not had the open door when 12 or 13. That equivalent year, in the consequence of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Beth Israel invited somewhere in the range of 75 and 100 evacuees from [[New Orleans]]. In 2006 Beth Israel had a participation of roughly 200 families which, interestingly with Mississippi's other Jewish assemblies, was gradually developing. Beth Israel's administrations were gone to by around 50 individuals in 2008. In 2013, the synagogue's windows were broken and "Jew" scratched into the paint of an entryway. 

Cohen acknowledged an idea to progress toward becoming rabbi of [[Temple Emanuel Sinai (Worcester, Massachusetts)|Temple Emanuel Sinai]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 2014. She was pursued at Beth Israel by break rabbis Ted Riter and Stephen Wylen. 

Jeffrey Kurtz-Lendner joined as rabbi in 2016. An alum of [[Brandeis University]] and the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]], he filled in as rabbi of the Northshore Jewish Congregation of [[Mandeville, Louisiana]] from 2002 to 2007, and Temple Solel in [[Hollywood, Florida]] from 2007 to 2015. By 2017, participation had achieved 214 families; that year, the assembly held its fiftieth yearly philanthropy nourishment bazaar, and commended its fiftieth year in the Old Clanton Road building. 

In acknowledgment of its commitments to the social equality development, the synagogue was included as a stop the Mississippi Freedom Trail in April, 2018.
