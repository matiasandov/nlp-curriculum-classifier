Edward Stephen Massey Poyntz (27 October 1883 Ã¢ÂÂ 26 December 1934) was an English five star cricketer, who played for Somerset in the mid twentieth century. A novice, Poyntz was a forceful right-gave batsman. He for the most part had as impact of the center request, and however his batting was not uncommon, he was very commended for his handling capacity. He captained Somerset in the two years preceding the First World War. 

The most youthful child of the Chief Constable of Essex, Poyntz made his district cricket debut in 1905, hitting 50 years to enable Somerset to win their solitary match of that season. He accomplished his best batting normal in that year, while every one of the accompanying four were of little note. In 1910 he captained Somerset out of the blue, and scored more than 300 keeps running in a season for the second of five events.

In the wake of serving in the Army amid the First World War, Poyntz scored his solitary century in top of the line cricket in a counterpart for the Army against Cambridge University in 1919. He played two further counterparts for Somerset that year, after which he didn't show up in top notch cricket once more. 

Poyntz was conceived on 27 October 1883 in Chelmsford, Essex. He was the most youthful of seven kids destined to Major William Henry Poyntz and Henrietta Laycock. His dad had accomplished the position of Major in the Royal Marines, and having filled in as the Chief Constable of Nottingham from 1872 until 1881, held the proportional position in Essex at the season of his most youthful child's introduction to the world. Poyntz senior was a cricket fan, and amid his time in Nottingham, he ran the police group, and composed gushingly in his memories about watching Nottinghamshire face Yorkshire and Surrey. Taught at Haileybury College, Massey made the school's cricket group in 1901. The family had moved to Gotham House in Tiverton, north Devon, and in the wake of leaving school, Poyntz pursued his more seasoned sibling Hugh into the Somerset side. 

On his presentation for Somerset, Poyntz batted unequivocally in the lower request to help secure Somerset's solitary triumph of the period. Poyntz's score of 32 in the main innings couldn't avert the pursue on, yet in the second innings, he hit 60 races to broaden Somerset's lead to very nearly 150 runs, an absolute Gloucestershire neglected to pursue down. His prosperity against Gloucestershire proceeded in the arrival installation later that season, in which he scored 89 of Somerset's aggregate of 169 in the main innings, and 42 keeps running in the second innings, however their adversaries won by an innings in the wake of storing up 521 keeps running in their solitary innings. Taking all things together, Poyntz played five matches in his presentation season, totalling 307 runs. His season's batting normal of 34.11 was the most noteworthy of his vocation. 

In David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, after the 1903 season he composed that "now is the ideal time carefully to jump over undistinguished seasons." Between 1903 and the discontinuance of district cricket because of the First World War, Somerset never completed higher than tenth in the County Championship. Poyntz himself battled for keeps running somewhere in the range of 1906 and 1909: in thirty counterparts for the region, he neglected to score 50 years. Factually, his most exceedingly awful season came in 1907, when he arrived at the midpoint of simply 4.66 runs per innings. His most striking episode that season happened amid the match against Middlesex at Lord's. In his very own advantage coordinate, Albert Trott guaranteed two cap traps; Poyntz was one of the people in question, falling for a second innings duck. 

In 1910, Poyntz captained Somerset out of the blue, remaining in amid the nonappearance of the customary chief, John Daniell. In that season, he struck his first 50 years since 1905, scoring 50 keeps running in the second innings of a match against Middlesex at Bath. He pursued that with another in his next innings, completing on 52 not out against Lancashire, however Somerset lost the two matches by an innings. He completed the 1910 season with 363 keeps running at a normal of 16.50, and showed up in a delegate coordinate for the West of England against the East. In their rundown of the 1911 season, "Wisden Cricketers' Almanac" guaranteed that "the standpoint for Somerset is depressed." The area completed base of the title with just a single triumph, against Hampshire at Bath. Regardless of this, Poyntz had a standout amongst his best seasons: he scored 597 keeps running at a normal of 22.96, and his five half-hundreds of years were the most in any time of his vocation. He started the season with half-hundreds of years in the two innings of a drawn match with Hampshire in Southampton, and two matches later, he bowled without precedent for five star cricket. Confronting Lancashire, Poyntz was called upon as Somerset's ninth bowler in their adversary's second innings: just the commander Daniell and the wicket-attendant, Harry Chidgey, did not bowl. Poyntz bowled eight overs and three balls, and guaranteed five wickets; his best investigation in top notch cricket. He kept on bowling once in a while for the rest of the period, yet just guaranteed three further wickets, and completed his vocation with a bowling normal of 39.62. Poyntz was unfit to show up as frequently in 1912; he just played multiple times for Somerset, six not exactly the season previously. He scored 253 keeps running at a normal 18.07 that year, and did not pass fifty keep running in an innings. 

Somerset's challenges were not restricted to the pitch. In 1912, the club made lost ÃÅ327, and they couldn't influence Daniell to stay at the club as opposed to venture out to India. At first the region asked Arthur Newton, who was around then 50 years of age, to fill in as chief, however after thought he declined the job, and Poyntz was designated. The group that he acquired remained a poor one: the "Wisden" synopsis in 1913 expressed that they had, "no impulse to bargain at any extraordinary length with the doings of Somerset". Amid a season in which his side had completed base of the title with just two successes, Poyntz scored 363 keeps running at a normal of 15.12, with a solitary 50 years; 50 runs precisely scored against Derbyshire. The club by and by recorded a misfortune amid the season, and at the club's yearly broad gathering, the temperament was negative. In spite of this, Poyntz was reappointed as commander for 1914 after a proposition made by Bruce Hylton-Stewart and favored by Newton. Uncommon positive thinking was appeared by Newton and Poyntz, with the last guaranteeing that it was because of "a great deal of misfortune that they [Somerset] did not wrap most of the way up the table rather than at the base." 

That positive thinking was not reflected in Somerset's outcomes the next year. Further monetary misfortunes were made, and the region completed second-base of the title. On an individual dimension, Poyntz scored a bigger number of keeps running than in some other season, accumulating 642 amid his 19 matches at a normal of 18.34, and scored three half-hundreds of years. The beginning of the First World War amid the mid year of 1914 brought about the crossing out of certain matches, alongside various players joining the military, upsetting the finish of the cricket season. Despite the fact that Somerset fared inadequately under his charge, David Foot guarantees that Poyntz got "more commendation than analysis" for his captaincy. 

In September 1914, Poyntz was named to the third Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment. He got advancement to Lieutenant, and afterward Captain in 1915, preceding being exchanged to the second Battalion in December of that year, serving in the Somme under the order of his sibling, Major Hugh Stainton Poyntz. He was presently appointed direction of "B" Company. He kept on telling B Company amid the Battle of the Somme. Poyntz instructed the second Battalion for some time in 1917 amid his sibling's leave, however burned through the greater part of the rest of the war available for later with the third Battalion. He finished his military administration as a Major. 

Poyntz just played three further top of the line cricket coordinates after the war. He made his most elevated aggregate amid a counterpart for the Army against Cambridge University, at Fenner's. Batting at number eight, he struck 15 fours and 3 sixes to achieve 114 keeps running in the second innings. The Army lost the match by 10 wickets. Later in the season, he his last appearances for Somerset, playing against Sussex and Hampshire under the captaincy of Daniell, averaging 10.00 from three innings. On the whole, Poyntz scored 3,127 keeps running amid his five star profession at a normal of 17.08. He passed on 26 December 1934 in Minehead, Somerset. 

Despite the fact that not exceedingly thought of as a batsman, Poyntz was known for having the capacity to hit the ball hard. A right-gave batsman, he is depicted as lacking "method and consistency" by David Foot, however eulogies propose that his deficiency of ability was counterbalanced by use of exertion. "Wisden" proclaimed him "an incredible defender", yet Foot is progressively held, depicting him as an "acceptable slip defender". Sammy Woods was Poyntz's adoptive parent, while Poyntz thusly went about as a back up parent to John Daniell's child Nigel. David Foot depicts a component of cartoon about Poyntz, portraying him as, "a tall man who pummeled his hair back with a particular separating in the center." He likewise related a story from a Somerset colleague in which Poyntz guaranteed that he could follow him family right back to William the Conqueror, and had a monstrous escutcheon in his Bristol level.
