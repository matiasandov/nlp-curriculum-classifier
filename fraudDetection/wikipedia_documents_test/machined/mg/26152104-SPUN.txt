To suit the more dominant drive framework, a third pipe was included. The shielded deck was additionally thickened fundamentally. The fourth ship of the class, "LÄÅºbeck", was fitted with steam turbines, so the nature of turbine motors could be contrasted and generally indistinguishable vessels. The "Bremen" class was trailed by the , which was fundamentally the same as the "Bremen"s, including a similar combat hardware. What's more, similar to the "Bremen"s, one ship of the class, , was outfitted with turbine motors while the rest had customary triple-development motor. 

The "Bremen"- class ships were long at the waterline and long generally speaking. They had a light emission a draft of forward. They dislodged as planned and between at full battle load. The boats' structures were developed with transverse and longitudinal steel outlines, and joined twelve watertight compartments. The bodies likewise had a twofold base that kept running for 56Ã¢Â percent of the length of the frame. 

Every one of the seven boats were great ocean pontoons, however they were wrench and moved up to twenty degrees. They were additionally exceptionally wet at high speeds and experienced a slight climate rudder. By the by, the boats turned firmly and were entirely flexibility.

"LÄÅºbeck" was rather fitted with a couple of Parsons steam turbines, appraised at and a top speed of , however every one of the seven boats surpassed these velocities on preliminaries. Every one of the seven boats had ten coal-terminated Marine-type water-tube boilers, which were trunked into three channels amidships. The boats conveyed up to of coal, which gave the initial three ships a scope of at ; "LÄÅºbeck"s less proficient turbine motors slice her cruising sweep to , while the last three boats of the class had a more drawn out range, at . "Bremen" and "Hamburg" had three generators that delivered an all out yield of 111Ã¢Â kilowatts at 110Ã¢Â volts; the remainder of the boats had two generators appraised at 90Ã¢Â kilowatts at a similar voltage.
