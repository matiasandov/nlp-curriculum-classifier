Van Dormael's movies, while few, have solid basic subjects between them. They utilize guileless voiceover and analyze the world from an honest viewpoint (the youthful Thomas in "All le hÄÅ¡ros", the rationally impeded hero of "Le huitiÄÂ¨me jour", and the unborn offspring of "Mr. No one"). These characters sees are regularly bright, innovative, and fairly expelled from the real world, with slight components of dreamlike symbolism used to show their dynamic creative impulses.

All of Van Dormael's movies contain strange components. In his initial two movies, these minutes were not many, such as moving blossoms in "All le hÄÅ¡ros" or Georges flying around the room in "Le huitiÄÂ¨me jour". "Mr. No one" makes considerably more broad utilization of dreamlike symbolism all through the film. 

Both "Toto le hÄÅ¡ros" and "Le huitiÄÂ¨me jour" unmistakably included characters with Down Syndrome, and depicted these characters affectionately, stressing their innocent qualities.
