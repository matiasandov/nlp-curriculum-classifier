In late 1981, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, and Rubeus Hagrid, teachers of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, convey an as of late stranded newborn child named Harry Potter to his solitary outstanding relatives, the Dursleys. After ten years, Harry has been fighting an incoherent existence with the Dursleys. After accidentally causing a mishap amid a family outing to the zoo, Harry starts getting spontaneous letters by owls. After the Dursleys departure to an island to keep away from more letters, Hagrid re-shows up and educates Harry that he is really a wizard and has been acknowledged into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' desires. In the wake of taking Harry to Diagon Alley to purchase his provisions for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid illuminates him regarding his past; Harry's folks James and Lily Potter met their downfall by means of a Killing Curse on account of the pernicious and all-amazing wizard: Lord Voldemort. Harry, the main survivor in the bedlam, in this way turns out to be notable in the wizarding scene as "The Boy Who Lived". 

Harry is then taken to King's Cross station to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets three different understudies: Ron Weasley, whom he rapidly gets to know; Hermione Granger, a canny witch destined to muggle guardians; and Draco Malfoy, a kid from an affluent wizarding family, with whom he promptly conflicts. Subsequent to landing at school the understudies gather in the Great Hall, where all the principal years are arranged by the Sorting Hat between four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. In spite of the fact that the Sorting Hat considers placing Harry in Slytherin with Draco, he is put into Gryffindor close by Ron and Hermione. 

At Hogwarts, Harry starts learning enchantment spells and finds increasingly about his past and guardians. In the wake of recouping the Remembrall of Gryffindor understudy Neville Longbottom, Harry is enlisted for Gryffindor's Quidditch group as a Seeker, an incredibly uncommon accomplishment for first-year understudies. While investigating the school one night, Harry, Ron, and Hermione find a goliath three-headed puppy named Fluffy in a limited territory of the school. Ron at that point affronts Hermione in the wake of being humiliated by her in a charms exercise, causing Hermione to secure herself in the young ladies' washroom. She is assaulted by a ravaging troll, yet Harry and Ron spare her - become friends with her all the while. 

The youngsters later discover Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, an article that has the ability to transform any metal into gold and produce a mixture that awards everlasting status. Harry suspects that mixtures educator and head of Slytherin House Severus Snape is attempting to acquire the stone so as to return Voldemort to physical structure. Hagrid unintentionally uncovers to the trio that Fluffy will nod off whenever played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione choose that night to attempt and locate the stone before Snape. They find an effectively sleeping Fluffy and face a progression of protections including a destructive plant known as Devil's Snare, a room loaded up with forceful flying keys that wound Harry, and an unsafe life-sized round of chess that nearly slaughters Ron. 

In the wake of moving beyond the undertakings, Harry finds that it was Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor Quirinus Quirrell who was endeavoring to guarantee the stone: Snape had really been ensuring Harry from the start. Quirrell expels his turban and uncovers a feeble Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through a charm set by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his ownership. Voldemort endeavors to deal the stone from Harry in return for restoring his folks, however Harry cannot. Quirrell endeavors to murder Harry accordingly; be that as it may, he is rather executed after Harry winds up consuming his skin - diminishing Quirrell to residue and making Voldemort's ascent from his fiery remains. Harry is thumped oblivious all the while. 

Harry recoups in the school medical clinic with Dumbledore next to him. Dumbledore clarifies that the stone has been demolished and that Ron and Hermione are sheltered. Dumbledore likewise uncovers how Harry had the capacity to crush Quirrell: when Harry's mom kicked the bucket to spare him, her demise gave Harry an affection based assurance against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are remunerated with house focuses for their chivalrous exhibitions - tying them for the lead position with Slytherin. Dumbledore then honors ten to Neville for endeavoring to stop the trio, conceding Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the late spring, upbeat to at long last have a genuine home in Hogwarts. 

Rowling demanded that the cast be kept British. Susie Figgis was selected as throwing chief, working with both Columbus and Rowling in trying out the lead jobs of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Open throwing calls were held for the primary three jobs, with just British kids being considered. The central tryouts occurred in three sections, with those trying out perusing a page from the novel, at that point to ad lib a scene of the understudies' landing in Hogwarts, lastly to peruse a few pages from the content before Columbus. Scenes from Columbus' content for the 1985 film "Youthful Sherlock Holmes" were likewise utilized in tryouts. On 11 July 2000, Figgis left the creation, whining that Columbus did not consider any of the a large number of youngsters they had tried out "commendable". On 8 August 2000, the for all intents and purposes obscure Daniel Radcliffe and newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were chosen to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, separately. 

In 1997, maker David Heyman looked for a youngsters' book that could be adjusted into a generally welcomed film. He had intended to create Diana Wynne Jones' tale "The Ogre Downstairs", however his arrangements failed to work out. His staff at Heyday Films at that point recommended "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", which his collaborator accepted was "a cool thought." Heyman pitched the plan to Warner Bros. furthermore, in 1999, Rowling sold the organization the rights to the initial four "Harry Potter" books for a detailed ÃÅ1Ã¢Â million (US$1,982,900). An interest Rowling made was that the foremost cast be kept carefully British, in any case taking into account the consideration of Irish performers, for example, Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for throwing of French and Eastern European on-screen characters in "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" where characters from the book are indicated accordingly. Rowling was reluctant to sell the rights since she "would not like to give them power over the remainder of the story" by pitching the rights to the characters, which would have empowered Warner Bros. to make non-writer composed spin-offs. 

Despite the fact that Steven Spielberg at first consulted to coordinate the film, he declined the offer. Spielberg apparently needed the adjustment to be an energized film, with American on-screen character Haley Joel Osment to give Harry Potter's voice, or a film that consolidated components from ensuing books also. Spielberg battled that, as he would see it, it resembled "shooting ducks in a barrel. It's only a pummel dunk. It's much the same as pulling back a billion dollars and placing it into your own financial balances. There's no test." Rowling keeps up that she had no job in picking chiefs for the movies and that "[a]nyone who supposes I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' [ sic ] him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill overhauled." Heyman reviewed that Spielberg chose to coordinate "A.I. Man-made brainpower." 

After Spielberg left, talks started with different executives, including: Chris Columbus, Terry Gilliam, Jonathan Demme, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Ivan Reitman, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, M. Night Shyamalan and Peter Weir. Petersen and Reiner both hauled out of the running in March 2000, and the decision was limited to Silberling, Columbus, Parker and Gilliam. Rowling's first decision chief was Terry Gilliam, however Warner Bros. picked Columbus, refering to his work on other family movies, for example, "Home Alone" and "Mrs. Doubtfire" as impacts for their choice. Columbus pitched his vision of the film for two hours, expressing that he needed the Muggle scenes "to be hopeless and terrible" yet those set in the wizarding scene "to be saturated with shading, temperament, and detail." He took motivation from David Lean's adjustments of "Incredible Expectations" (1946) and "Oliver Twist" (1948), wishing to utilize "that kind of murkiness, that kind of edge, that quality to the cinematography," while being additionally enlivened by the shading structures from "Oliver!" (1968) and "The Godfather" (1972). 

Steve Kloves was chosen to compose the screenplay. He depicted adjusting the book as "extreme", as it didn't "fit adjustment just as the following two books." Kloves frequently gotten rundowns of books proposed as film adjustments from Warner Bros., which he "never read", however "Harry Potter" bounced out at him. He went out and purchased the book, and turned into a moment aficionado of the arrangement. When addressing Warner Bros., he expressed that the film must be British, and must be consistent with the characters. Kloves was apprehensive when he initially met Rowling as he didn't need her to think he was going to "[destroy] her child." Rowling conceded that she "was truly prepared to loathe this Steve Kloves," however reviewed her underlying gathering with him: "The first occasion when I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my most loved character is?' And I thought, You're going to state Ron. I know you're going to state Ron. Yet, he said 'Hermione.' And I only sort of liquefied." Rowling got a lot of inventive control, a plan that Columbus did wouldn't fret. 

Warner Bros. had at first intended to discharge the movie more than 4 July 2001 end of the week, making for such a short creation window, that few proposed executives hauled themselves out of the running. Because of time requirements, the date was returned to 16 November 2001. 

Two British film industry authorities mentioned that the film be shot in the United Kingdom, offering their help with verifying shooting areas, the utilization of Leavesden Film Studios, just as changing the UK's tyke work laws (including few working hours out of each week and making the planning of on-set classes increasingly adaptable). Warner Bros. acknowledged their proposition. Recording started on 29 September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and closed on 23 March 2001, with conclusive work being done in July. Vital photography occurred on 2 October 2000 at North Yorkshire's Goathland railroad station. Canterbury Cathedral and Scotland's Inverailort Castle were both touted as conceivable areas for Hogwarts; Canterbury rejected Warner Bros. proposition because of worries about the film's "agnostic" subject. Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral were in the end chosen as the central areas for Hogwarts, with certain scenes likewise being recorded at Harrow School. Different Hogwarts scenes were recorded in Durham Cathedral over a fourteen day time frame; these included shots of the passages and some study hall scenes. Oxford University's Divinity School filled in as the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, and Duke Humfrey's Library, some portion of the Bodleian, was utilized as the Hogwarts Library. Shooting for Privet Drive occurred on Picket Post Close in Bracknell, Berkshire. Shooting in the road took two days rather than the arranged single day, so installments to the road's inhabitants were correspondingly expanded. For all the ensuing film's scenes set in Privet Drive, taping occurred on a built set in Leavesden Film Studios, which demonstrated to have been less expensive than recording on area. London's Australia House was chosen as the area for Gringotts Wizarding Bank, while Christ Church, Oxford was the area for the Hogwarts trophy room. London Zoo was utilized as the area for the scene in which Harry incidentally sets a snake on Dudley, with King's Cross Station likewise being utilized as the book determines. 

Since the American title was extraordinary, all scenes that notice the scholar's stone by name must be re-shot, once with the on-screen characters saying "philosopher's" and once with "sorcerer's". The kids taped for four hours and after that completed three hours of schoolwork. They built up a preference for phony facial wounds from the cosmetics staff. Radcliffe was at first intended to wear green contact focal points as his eyes are blue, and not green like Harry's, however the focal points gave Radcliffe extraordinary bothering. Upon meeting with Rowling, it was concurred that Harry could have blue eyes. 

Judianna Makovsky structured the ensembles. She re-structured the Quidditch robes, having at first intended to utilize those appeared on the front of the American book, however considered them "a wreck." Instead, she dressed the Quidditch players in "preppie sweaters, nineteenth century fencing breeches and arm monitors." Production fashioner Stuart Craig manufactured the sets at Leavesden Studios, including Hogwarts Great Hall, putting together it with respect to numerous English houses of prayer. Albeit initially requested to utilize a current old road to film the Diagon Alley scenes, Craig chose to construct his own set, including Tudor, Georgian and Queen Anne engineering. 

Columbus initially wanted to utilize both animatronics and CGI activity to make the enchanted animals, including Fluffy. Scratch Dudman, who took a shot at "", was given the undertaking of making the required prosthetics, with Jim Henson's Creature Shop giving animal impacts. John Coppinger expressed that the supernatural animals that should have been made must be structured on various occasions. The film includes about 600 enhancements shots, including various organizations. Mechanical Light and Magic made Lord Voldemort's face on the back of Quirrell, Rhythm and Hues vivified Norbert (Hagrid's infant mythical serpent); and Sony Pictures Imageworks delivered the Quidditch scenes. 

John Williams was chosen to create the score. Williams formed the score at his homes in Los Angeles and Tanglewood before chronicle it in London in September 2001. One of the fundamental topics is entitled "Hedwig's Theme"; Williams held it for his completed score as "everybody appeared to like it" and subsequently it was a common subject all through the arrangement. 

Columbus over and over checked with Rowling to ensure he was getting minor subtleties right. Kloves depicted the film as being "extremely devoted" to the book. He included discourse, of which Rowling endorsed. One of the lines initially included must be evacuated subsequent to Rowling revealed to him that it would straightforwardly negate an occasion in the then-unreleased fifth "Harry Potter" novel "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix". 

A few minor characters have been expelled from the film adaptation, most unmistakable among them the phantom History of Magic instructor, Professor Binns, and Peeves the apparition. The book's first part is from the perspective of Vernon and Petunia Dursley the day preceding they are offered Harry to care for, featuring how non-enchanted individuals respond to enchantment. The film evacuates this, start with Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leaving Harry with the Dursleys (in spite of the fact that McGonagall discloses to Dumbledore how she had been viewing the Dursleys throughout the day). Harry's not exactly wonderful occasions at Mrs. Figg's are cut from the film while the boa constrictor from Brazil in the zoo turns into a Burmese Python in the film. A few clashes, for example, Harry and Draco's experience with one another in Madam Malkin's robe shop and midnight duel, are not in the film. Some of Nicolas Flamel's job is changed or cut through and through. Norbert is referenced to have been removed by Dumbledore in the film; while the book sees Harry and Hermione need to take him by hand to Charlie Weasley's companions. Rowling portrayed the scene as "the one piece of the book that she felt [could easily] be changed". Thus, the purpose behind the confinement in the Forbidden Forest was changed: In the novel, Harry and Hermione are placed in detainment for being gotten by Filch when leaving the Astronomy Tower night-time, Neville and Malfoy are given confinement when gotten in the passage by Professor McGonagall. In the film, Harry, Hermione and Ron get detainment after Malfoy gets them in Hagrid's cottage twilight (Malfoy notwithstanding, is given confinement for being up nightfall). Firenze the centaur, who is depicted in the book as being palomino with light blonde hair, is appeared to be dull in the film. The Quidditch pitch is adjusted from a customary arena to an open field hovered by observer towers. In the trio's last mission for the Philosopher's Stone, Hermione's test, taking care of a rationale issue about a column of containers, is overlooked.
