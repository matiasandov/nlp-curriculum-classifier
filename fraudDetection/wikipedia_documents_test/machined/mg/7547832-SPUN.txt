A great part of the southern portion of Puerto Rico detailed over (178Ã¢Â mm). Vieques got around 7Ã¢Â inches of precipitation, while Culebra experienced over . The overwhelming precipitation brought about freshwater flooding. The most grounded breezes of the tempest stayed seaward, and wind blasts crested at in Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. Winds and precipitation on the island brought about brought down trees and electrical cables, however harm was insignificant. Klaus struck the island on decision day, making slight interruptions the procedure. 

Holy person John in the United States Virgin Islands detailed over of precipitation in relationship with Tropical Storm Klaus. Both Saint Thomas and Saint Croix got around 10Ã¢Â inches, while precipitation in the British Virgin Islands stayed underneath 10Ã¢Â inches. Hurricane Klaus caused serious flooding and broad harm all through the U.S. Virgin Islands. Solid southwesterly breezes brought about intense breezes and unpleasant oceans along the southwestern parts of the Leeward Islands. The harsh waves made impressive harm marine interests in the zone. In Anguilla, three boats were destroyed. off of Saint Martin, the harsh oceans destroyed a voyage transport. The 60 travelers and 23 group individuals swam securely to shore, however one individual was hospitalized. Unpleasant oceans additionally harmed neighborhood coral reefs. 10,000Ã¢Â people were influenced on the island of Dominica.
