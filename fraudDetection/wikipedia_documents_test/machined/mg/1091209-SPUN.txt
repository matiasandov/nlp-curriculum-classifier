Al-Mu'tazz 

AbÄºÅ¥ ÄÅ¼Abd AllÃ¤Âh MuÃ¡Â¸Ä¾ammad ibn JaÄÅ¼far (; 847 Ã¢ÂÂ 16 July 869), better known by his regnal title al-MuÄÅ¼tazz bi-ÄÅ¾llÃ¤Âh (, "He who is fortified by God") was the Abbasid caliph from 866 to 869, amid a time of extraordinary inner flimsiness inside the Abbasid Caliphate, known as the "Rebellion at Samarra". 

Initially named as the second in line of three beneficiaries of his dad al-Mutawakkil, al-Mu'tazz was compelled to disavow his rights after the promotion of his sibling al-Muntasir, and was tossed behind bars as a hazardous adversary amid the rule of his cousin al-Musta'in. He was discharged and brought to the caliphate up in January 866, amid the common war between al-Musta'in and the Turkish military of Samarra. Al-Mu'tazz was fit and resolved to reassert the expert of the caliph over the Turkish military, yet had just restricted achievement. Supported by the vizier Ahmad ibn Isra'il, he figured out how to evacuate and slaughter the main Turkish commanders, Wasif al-Turki and Bugha al-Saghir, however the decay of the Tahirids in Baghdad denied him of their job as a stabilizer to the Turks. Looked with the confident Turkish authority Salih ibn Wasif, and unfit to discover cash to fulfill the requests of his troops, he was ousted and passed on of abuse a couple of days after the fact, on 16 July 869. 

His rule denotes the apogee of the decay of the Caliphate's focal expert, and the peak of radiating inclinations, communicated through the rise of the independent traditions of the Tulunids in Egypt and the Saffarids in the East, Alid uprisings in Hejaz and Tabaristan, and the primary stirrings of the incomparable Zanj Rebellion in lower Iraq. 

The future al-Mu'tazz was destined to the Caliph al-Mutawakkil () from his most loved slave mistress, Qabiha. In 849, al-Mutawakkil masterminded his progression, by selecting three of his children as beneficiaries and allotting them the administration and continues of the realm's areas: the oldest, al-Muntasir, was named first beneficiary, and got Egypt, the Jazira, and the returns of the rents in the capital, Samarra; al-Mu'tazz was accused of overseeing the spaces of the Tahirid customer tradition in the East; and al-Mu'ayyad was set accountable for Syria. In any case, after some time the support of al-Mutawakkil moved towards al-Mu'tazz. Empowered by his most loved counselor, al-Fath ibn Khaqan, and the vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan, the Caliph started considering naming al-Mu'tazz as his first beneficiary, and barring al-Muntasir from the progression. The competition between the two sovereigns reflected strains in the political circle, as al-Mu'tazz's progression seems to have been supported by the customary Abbasid elites too, while al-Muntasir was upheld by the Turkish and "Maghariba" protect troops. 

In October 861, the Turkish officers started a plot to kill the Caliph. They were before long joined, or possibly implicitly upheld, by al-Muntasir, whose relations with his dad weakened quickly. On 5 December, al-Muntasir was avoided for al-Mu'tazz for driving the custom Friday supplication toward the finish of Ramadan, toward the finish of which his dad's consultant al-Fath and the vizier Ubayd Allah decisively kissed his hands and feet, before going with him on the arrival to the royal residence; and on 9 December al-Mutawakkil, among different mortifications incurred on him, took steps to kill his oldest child. Thus, the evening of 10/11 December, the Turks executed al-Mutawakkil and al-Fath, and al-Muntasir progressed toward becoming caliph. Very quickly, al-Muntasir sent for his siblings to come and give the promise of faithfulness ("bay'ah") to him. Therefore, when the vizier Ubayd Allah, after being educated regarding al-Mutawakkil's demise, went to the place of al-Mu'tazz, he didn't discover him there; and when his supporters, including the "abna' al-dawla" and others and numbering a few thousands, assembled in the first part of the day and asked him to storm the royal residence, he cannot, with the words "our man is in their grasp". The homicide of al-Mutawakkil started the turbulent period known as "Insurgency at Samarra", which went on until 870 and conveyed the Abbasid Caliphate to the edge of breakdown. 

Forced by the Turkish officers Wasif al-Turki and Bugha al-Saghir, both al-Mu'tazz and al-Mu'ayyad revoked their places in the progression on 27 April 862. Be that as it may, al-Muntasir passed on in June 862, without having named any new beneficiary. The Turks presently fortified their hold over the legislature, and chose a cousin of al-Muntasir, al-Musta'in (), as the new caliph. The new caliph was very quickly looked with a huge uproar in Samarra in help of al-Mu'tazz; the agitators, who included the "showcase riffraff", yet in addition soldiers of fortune from the "Shakiriyya" troops. The uproar was somewhere near the "Maghariba" and "Ushrusaniyya" regiments, however setbacks on the two sides were substantial. Al-Musta'in, stressed that al-Mu'tazz or al-Mua'yyad could press their cases to the caliphate, first endeavored to get them off by offering them a yearly appropriation of 80,000 gold dinars. Soon after, be that as it may, their properties were confiscatedÃ¢ÂÂaccording to al-Tabari, that of al-Mu'tazz was esteemed at ten million "dirhams"Ã¢ÂÂand detained under the sponsorship of Bugha al-Saghir in one of the rooms of the Jawsaq Palace. 

Contentions between the Turkish heads prompted a split in 865, when al-Musta'in, Wasif and Bugha left Samarra for Baghdad, where they landed on 5/6 February 865. There they were joined by numerous individuals of their adherents, and aligned with the city's Tahirid senator, Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir, who started invigorating the city. The main part of the Turks, in any case, stayed in Samarra. Their position undermined by this alliance, they discharged al-Mu'tazz and declared him caliph. On 24 February, al-Mu'tazz put his sibling Abu Ahmad (the future al-Muwaffaq) accountable for the military, and sent him to lay attack to Baghdad. Abu Ahmad assumed a main job in the attack, which made a nearby and enduring association with the Turkish military, that would later enable him to rise as the virtual official of the caliphate close by his sibling al-Mu'tamid (). 

The attack delayed until December 865, when a mix of privations, absence of cash to pay its supporters, and the value climbs brought about by the attack disintegrated support for al-Musta'in's routine. Thus, Muhammad ibn Tahir opened exchanges with the besiegers, and a settlement was achieved, which added up to a common trade off over the sharing of the realm's returns: the Turks and different troops of Samarra got 66% of yearly state income, while the rest of go to Ibn Tahir and his Baghdad powers. As a component of the understanding, al-Musta'in would relinquish, in return for a yearly annuity of 30,000 dinars. Therefore on 25 January 866, after the surrender of Baghdad, al-Mu'tazz turned out to be authoritatively the sole, real caliph. 

Despite the fact that he was set upon the position of authority by the Turks, al-Musta'in demonstrated a competent ruler, and resolved to reestablish the expert and freedom of his office. He named as his vizier Ahmad ibn Isra'il, who had in the past filled in as his secretary amid al-Mutawakkil's rule. Al-Mu'tazz moved rapidly to sideline any potential opponents. In this manner, in spite of his promise of security to al-Musta'in, in October/November 866 al-Mu'tazz had his forerunner killed at al-Katul in Samarra. Similarly he had his more youthful sibling al-Mu'ayyad executed, even in the wake of constraining him to again disavow his rights to progression. At long last, Abu Ahmad, albeit at first invited with much respect by the Caliph for his job in winning the common war, was additionally detained alongside al-Mu'ayyad. Be that as it may, his help among the military spared his life. He was in the long run discharged and sent to Basra, before being permitted to settle in Baghdad. The Caliph at that point focused on the incredible Turkish officers Wasif al-Turki and Bugha al-Saghir. The principal move against them in late 866 bombed because of the resistance of the military, and the two men were reestablished to their posts. In the following year, notwithstanding, Wasif was murdered by Turkish troops that had mutinied requesting the installment of their unpaid debts, while Bugha was detained and executed on the Caliph's requests in 868. Another ground-breaking Turkish authority, Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir, was adequately ousted to Hamadan in the meantime. 

Regardless of these triumphs, the Caliph couldn't beat the fundamental issue of the period: a deficiency of income with which to pay the troops. The budgetary straits of the Caliphate had turned out to be clear as of now at his accessionÃ¢ÂÂthe standard promotion donative of ten months' compensation for the troops must be diminished to two for absence of fundsÃ¢ÂÂand had cut down the routine of al-Musta'in in Baghdad. The common war and the following general insurgency just exacerbated the circumstance, as income prevented coming in even from the environs of Baghdad, not to mention progressively remote areas. Thus, al-Mu'tazz would not respect his concurrence with Ibn Tahir in Baghdad, abandoning him to accommodate his own supporters; this prompted turmoil in the city and the fast decay of Tahirid specialist. The strife in Baghdad was exacerbated by al-Mu'tazz, who in 869 expelled Ibn Tahir's sibling and successor Ubaydallah, and supplanted him with his far less proficient sibling Sulayman. In the occasion, this just served to deny the Caliph of a helpful stabilizer against the Samarra soldiery, and enabled the Turks to recapture their previous power. 

Subsequently, by 869 the Turkish heads Salih ibn Wasif (the child of Wasif al-Turki) and Ba'ikbak were again in the ascendant, and verified the evacuation of Ahmad ibn Isra'il. At last, unfit to fulfill the monetary needs of the Turkish troops, in mid-July a royal residence upset dismissed al-Mu'tazz. He was detained and abused to such a degree, that he passed on following three days, on 16 July 869. He was prevailing by his cousin al-Muhtadi. 

In spite of his endeavors to fortify his position and reestablish authority over the military, al-Mutazz's rule is set apart by flimsiness and uncertainty, and by his definitive inability to repress the military. This shortcoming in the inside sustained the divergent inclinations officially clear in the Caliphate's regions. In Egypt, the capable Turkish officer Ahmad ibn Tulun was delegated senator in 868, and continued to build up the self-ruling Tulunid administration. In spite of the fact that it tumbled to the Abbasids in 905, the Tulunid routine had built up Egypt as a particular political element out of the blue since the Pharaohs. Reestablished Abbasid rule demonstrated unstable; another nearby tradition, the Ikhshidids, took control in 935, trailed by the nation's triumph by the Abbasids' adversaries, the Fatimid Caliphate, in 969. In the east, Alid uprisings debilitated Tahirid guideline, and prompted the foundation of a Zaydi state in Tabaristan, under Hasan ibn Zayd. In the meantime, Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar started his attack on the fading Tahirids, which would lead him to command over the eastern territories of the Caliphate, and even a fruitless endeavor to seize the caliphal honored position itself in 876. Closer to home, Kharijite revolts shook the Jazira toward the north, and in the south, around Basra, the primary stirrings of the incomparable Zanj Rebellion started.
