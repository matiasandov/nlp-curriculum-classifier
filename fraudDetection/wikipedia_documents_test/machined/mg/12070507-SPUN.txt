For what reason didn't the administration make a move prior against the priests in light of the fact that had that been the situation such a large number of lives would not have been lost? For what reason were the Lal Masjid components permitted so much space that the complex turned out to be practically similar to a state inside a state, total with an ethical policing power which acted without any potential repercussions authorizing an unbending elucidation of Islam on the city's occupants? How did as such many solidified aggressors, allegedly a few outsiders among them, advance inside the compound arranged in the core of Islamabad?". 

"The Post" was stressed over how the scene would influence Pakistan: "This is going to fasten up religious notions, and could prompt expanded polarization between the conservatives and radicals in the nation, the previous including General Musharraf under the flag of 'illuminated balance'." "The Islam" paper censured the legislature, expressing, "The administration can't clear itself of the catastrophe. In the event that it needed, the issue could have been settled toward the begin. In any case, this was not done and, without precedent for the historical backdrop of Pakistan, our own security powers besieged a mosque and religious theological college, yet in addition got protected staff bearers, tanks and helicopter gunships in numbers that made you wonder.

"Nawa-I-Waqt" wrote in its article, "The whole country is suffocated in stun and distress today. They are grieving the beast utilization of power. Presently we need an exhaustive request over the activity against the Red Mosque. The report ought to be influenced open so the general population to can know the established truths." The "Ausaf" day by day countered, "The whole country is lamenting... just the USA needed what occurred and evidence of that will be that the raging task was praised at the White House and Pentagon as opposed to at General Musharraf's HQ."

The EU additionally commended the "limitation and balance appeared by the Pakistani specialists." 

US President George W. Bramble gave his help to Musharraf as "a solid partner in the war against these radicals." State Department appointee representative Tom Casey noticed that the aggressors had been given numerous alerts before the commandos proceeded onward the Red Mosque. He stated, "The legislature of Pakistan has continued in a mindful manner. All administrations have an obligation to save request." Bryan D.

A significant number of the activist Pakistanis in Waziristan and on the outskirt with Kashmir had youthful relative in the broke mosque, and they started assaulting the military in retribution. This broke or possibly severely harmed the "long standing partnership" between the Deobandi jihadis and the military. 

The Lal Masjid attack gave hardliners in Pakistan a reviving point, just as creating new saints (for example volunteers to end it all bombings) and inciting al-Qaeda, Jaish-e-Muhammad, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and the Taliban to dispatch countering assaults in Pakistan.
