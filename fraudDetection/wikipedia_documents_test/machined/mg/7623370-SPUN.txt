Angling Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River tributary) 

Angling Creek is a long tributary of the Susquehanna River in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It joins the Susquehanna River close to the evaluation assigned spot of Rupert and the town of Bloomsburg. The watershed has a territory of . 

Traveling Native Americans touched base in the lower compasses of Fishing Creek around 8000 BCE, and some were spending winters in the upper scopes of the valley by 3000 to 2000 BCE. In the previous couple of hundreds of years, the Fishing Creek zone has been home to numerous enterprises, factories, and dams. It channels portions of five Pennsylvania areas: Columbia, Montour, Sullivan, Luzerne, and Lycoming. The rivulet's principle tributaries incorporate Hemlock Creek, Little Fishing Creek, Green Creek, Huntington Creek, West Branch Fishing Creek, and East Branch Fishing Creek. 

Open amusement exercises incorporate kayaking, birdwatching, and angling. The stream is known for its trout populace, which incorporates creek, darker and rainbow trout; it likewise contains numerous different types of fish. Northern hardwood trees and ruffed grouse live in the encompassing territory. 

A few stretches of Fishing Creek contain huge measures of green growth on account of releasing septic frameworks in the watershed. The territory around the tributary West Creek is the least livable piece of the Fishing Creek region, as indicated by a recent report. The water nature of Fishing Creek can fluctuate. Its pH ranges from 4.9 to 8.5, while the grouping of broke up oxygen ranges from 5 to 17.5Ã¢Â mg per liter. The brook's normal release is 615 cubic feet for every second (17.4 m/s); its watershed contains rock, shale and different loamsÃ¢ÂÂin specific the Albrights soil arrangement and the Leck Kill soil. 

Angling Creek's source is above ocean level in Sugarloaf Township, south of State Game Lands Number 13 and Pennsylvania Route 118, where East Branch and West Branch Fishing Creeks of southern Sullivan County meet in northern Columbia County. The river heads roughly south with a couple of curves through Sugarloaf Township for about . In the southern piece of the township, it turns east for not exactly a mile and gets Coles Creekits first named tributary after the intersection of the East and West Branches. It purges into Fishing Creek from the upper east, upstream of its mouth. 

Around this point, Fishing Creek transforms strongly south into Benton Township and begins streaming parallel to Pennsylvania Route 487. Here it streams four or five miles, incorporating about a mile in Benton, where West Creek parallels Fishing Creek and discharges into it from the west only south of Benton and upstream of the mouth. Angling Creek crosses under Pennsylvania Route 239 and proceeds with roughly south, going through the network of Maple Grove and streaming into Fishing Creek Township and Stillwater. In Stillwater, Raven Creek purges into the brook from the upper east, over the mouth. About south, the river turns and grabs Huntington Creek, and after that streams past the networks of Zaners, Forks, and Pealertown. The mouth of Huntington Creek is over the mouth of Fishing Creek. 

After leaving Fishing Creek Township, about in the wake of grabbing Huntington Creek, Fishing Creek streams southwest past Knob Mountain and into Orange Township. It goes close to the northern edge of Knob Mountain downstream, at that point by Orangeville, and makes a 90Ã¢Â° swing toward the northwest. Not long after this turn it grabs Green Creek over its mouth and turns west. After some separation, it turns south once more, passing Bowman Bridge and a checking station. Starting here, the spring streams along the fringe among Orange and Mount Pleasant Townships for nearly . While on the outskirt between these two townships, it streams past Kocher Park. The stream stays impressively closer toward the western edge of the waterway valley than the eastern edge now. Close Lightstreet, it transforms west into Mount Pleasant Township, passing a few lakes and the Turkey Hill Oxbow. After entering Mount Pleasant Township, the rivulet quits paralleling Pennsylvania Route 487 and streams in the region of Interstate 80 for . 

Along the fringe of Mount Pleasant Township and Bloomsburg, Fishing Creek grabs Little Fishing Creek at a separation of upstream of its mouth before turning south and paralleling the western outskirt of Bloomsburg. As it streams among Bloomsburg and Fernville, it turns forcefully westbound, paralleling U.S. Highway 11, and gets Hemlock Creek, which is over the mouth. Not long after getting Hemlock Creek, Fishing Creek turns southeast under U.S. Highway 11 and streams parallel to Pennsylvania Route 42 for somewhat over , getting Montour Run from the right, at that point discharges later into the Susquehanna among Bloomsburg and Rupert. The Rupert Covered Bridge No. 56 crosses the principle stem of the spring. Its mouth is above ocean level lower than, and downstream of, the source. 

Angling Creek has a few noteworthy tributaries and various minor ones. The significant tributaries are Hemlock Creek, Little Fishing Creek, Green Creek, Huntington Creek, and the East and West Branch Fishing Creeks. West Branch Fishing Creek ascends on North Mountain and streams east into Fishing Creek. East Branch Fishing Creek is a tributary that begins on North Mountain in Sullivan County and is around long. Huntington Creek begins in State Game Lands number 57 and heads southwest through Luzerne County until it achieves the north side of Knob Mountain, which it runs parallel to until it converges with Fishing Creek. Huntington Creek depletes the eastern and northeastern pieces of the Fishing Creek watershed. Four secured spans cross Huntington Creek; these are the Twin BridgesÃ¢ÂÂEast Paden Covered Bridge No. 120, the Twin BridgesÃ¢ÂÂWest Paden Covered Bridge No. 121, the Josiah Hess Covered Bridge No. 122, and the Huntington Mills Bridge. 

Green Creek ascends close Waller and heads generally south to Rohrsburg and on to Orangeville, where it joins Fishing Creek. It depletes the focal piece of the Fishing Creek watershed. Small Fishing Creek begins just in Lycoming County close to the Columbia County Line. It twists through provincial zones before achieving Pennsylvania Route 42, which it runs parallel to for the rest of its length. It depletes the western piece of the Fishing Creek watershed. Four secured spans cross Little Fishing Creek; these are the Wanich Covered Bridge No. 69, the Sam Eckman Covered Bridge No. 92, the Jud Christie Covered Bridge No. 95, and the Creasyville Covered Bridge. 

Different tributaries of the fundamental stem incorporate Coles Creek and West Creek close Benton, Raven Creek in Fishing Creek Township, Hemlock Creek in Hemlock Township, Montour Run in Montour Township, and Deerlick Run and Stony Brook, both close Orange Township. 

Angling Creek depletes a large portion of Columbia County north of the Susquehanna River aside from a region in the eastern piece of the area, which is depleted by Briar Creek. It additionally depletes southern Sullivan County and western Luzerne County. Minor tributaries channel little bits of Montour County and southeastern Lycoming County. The upper piece of the watershed is 85 percent woods and 13 percent farmland. Close to its source, the other two percent is private; closer to Benton, the rest of urban. The spring's seepage bowl comprises of various sub-watersheds. The biggest ones are the Huntington Creek watershed, with a region of 114 square miles; the Little Fishing Creek watershed, with a territory of 68.1 square miles; the Green Creek waste bowl, with a zone of 36.9 square miles; and the West Branch Fishing Creek seepage bowl, with a zone of 32.9 square miles. 

Northern Bloomsburg and Scott Township incorporate a little oxbow pool of Fishing Creek; the zone around this lake is known as the Turkey Hill Oxbow. The lake is situated between Interstate 80 and the woodlands in favor of Turkey Hill. The oxbow is on a flood plain and incorporates grasses, forested wetlands, and territories of vast water. In wet times of the year, the Turkey Hill Oxbow lake gets flood from the waters of Fishing Creek while amid dry periods it contains water in just a couple of spots. 

Most land around the oxbow is steep. It is secured by hemlock and hardwood backwoods, just as skunk cabbage leaks. The timberlands around the lake additionally contain dark birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and Norway maple, while the understory contains elusive elm, European privet, Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain shrub, ironwood, and the uncommon American yew. The American yew populace was in noteworthy decay by 2004 because of overwhelming brushing by deer. 

There are various wildflower species in the uplands and shake outcroppings of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. These incorporate white baneberry, northern maidenhair plant, spikenard, blue cohosh, foamflower, false Solomon's seal, purple trillium, and wild columbine. Creatures possessing the territories encompassing the pools incorporate pickerel frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, and snapping turtles. Plants in this area incorporate broadleaf sharpened stone, northern blueflag, nourishment grasses, water starwort, and a few assortments of sedges. Japanese knotweed has been seen close Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. 

Having first possessed Pennsylvania somewhere in the range of 16,000 and 10,000 BCE, traveling Native Americans achieved the zone close to the mouth of Fishing Creek by 8000 BCE. By 3000 to 2000 BCE, some of them were going into the Fishing Creek valley amid the winter to chase deer and bears and coming back to the Susquehanna River in the mid year, making exchange courses. There was no changeless residence until 1000 BCE when some Native American towns were worked at the mouth of Fishing Creek. The Native Americans who settled here incorporated the Shawnee and Susquehannock Indians. A Native American way kept running along the rivulet from Bloomsburg to Orangeville before dismissing toward Tunkhannock Creek. Since somewhere around 1769, there has additionally been a way between the mouths of Huntington and Green Creeks. 

The primary parcels at the mouth of Fishing Creek were reviewed in 1769 when European pioneers started moving into the region, and around the same time, the Penn family bought 1060 sections of land (430 hectares) of land upstream of Benton. In 1778, Moses Van Campen constructed a fortress of logs secured with earth with a little swivel gun on Fishing Creek to ensure pioneers on the wilderness. There were pioneers on the rivulet in Orange Township in 1780, and the Fishing Creek valley north of Orangeville, in what is currently Stillwater, was first settled in 1783 by Daniel McHenry. The headwaters of the spring were settled in the late 1780s and mid 1790s. Leonard Rupert built up a ship on the river in 1786. The main sawmill on the upper segment of Fishing Creek was worked in the late 1790s; it was pulverized in a flood in 1848. 

The main plant in Sugarloaf Township was worked close by Fishing Creek in 1802, and another factory in a similar township was noted for its buckwheat flour. A school building had been worked by 1806. In 1818, John Barton manufactured a flour and grist factory on Fishing Creek. It was devastated by flame in 1855 and again in 1905. In spite of the fact that remade, it torched again in 1932. Another gristmill remained on the brook until 1830 when it was changed over into a paper plant. Iron mineral was found in the territory of Fishing Creek in 1822, and in 1844, an anthracite-consuming heater was based on the rivulet close Bloomsburg. In the nineteenth century, a water system was worked over the brook. From around 1840 to 1900, the wagon-production industry was critical to the upper Fishing Creek territory. Another memorable industry was the Susquehanna Slate Company, which worked in the late nineteenth century. The Fishing Creek Confederacy (AugustÃ¢ÂÂNovember 1864) amid the American Civil War was an associated uprising with a high number of traitors and draft dodgers. A thousand fighters involved and looked through the Fishing Creek valley and the mountains of its headwaters yet were unfit to discover any betrayers. In any case, 100 inhabitants of Columbia County were captured and detained for abandonment and draft avoidance albeit most were later discharged. Beginning in 1877, the Bloomsburg Water Company utilized Fishing Creek as its water supply. The Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad, which paralleled the river, was worked in 1888. 

There were limestone mines at the intersection of Fishing Creek and Little Fishing Creek, yet these have not been utilized since something like 1887. Amid the Great Depression, a shoreline was built on the rivulet close Fernville by the Works Progress Administration. After the stream overflowed in 1972 from Hurricane Agnes, a glimmer flood cautioning framework was introduced there. In 2002, a tract of land from the Custer/Kocher estate on Fishing Creek close Lightstreet was changed over into a recreation center called the Frank W. Kocher Memorial Park, which was later extended to cover . In the 21st century, the main noteworthy industry in the watershed is the Benton Foundry. 

Around downstream of Orangeville a checking station was built up on the spring in 1938. Other observing of the river has included nitty gritty examinations at a stream-measuring station close Bloomsburg, which worked from 2002 to 2012. 

Only downstream of Orangeville, Fishing Creek's release midpoints , with a middle of . The most minimal recorded release was while the most noteworthy was . Further upstream in Benton, it is quite often not exactly , and for the most part approaches zero amid the mid year. The run of the mill release is around . In long stretches of dry spell, the streambeds of West Branch and East Branch Fishing Creeks ordinarily run dry for 105 days over summer; even in wet years they are dry for a normal of 5 days. Close Bloomsburg, Fishing Creek's release has gone between and . 

Close Benton, Fishing Creek's pH ranges from around 5.6 to 7.25, while close Bloomsburg, a more extensive territory has been recorded, from 5.8 to 8.5. Close Camp Lavigne, it ranges from 5.5 to 7.1. East Branch Fishing Creek is the main stream in the watershed whose pH dips under 5.5; it can fall as low as 4.9. West Creek and Coles Creek are the least acidic streams in the watershed, with pH levels more often than not above 6.3 and frequently over 7. Ordinarily, the spring and its tributaries are not in danger of ending up unreasonably acidic for the ideal strength of fish, yet in late-winter amid snowmelts, the dimensions approach the point of confinement that rivulet trout can endure. Angling Creek's waters are acidic on account of corrosive downpour. 

The convergence of broke down oxygen in Fishing Creek ranges from around 5 to 17.5Ã¢Â mg/L at Benton. A site close Camp Lavigne had marginally less fluctuation, going from 8 to 17Ã¢Â mg/L. The fixation close Bloomsburg went somewhere in the range of 4.1 and 17.1Ã¢Â mg/L, with a normal of 10.9Ã¢Â mg/L. The measure of carbon dioxide close Bloomsburg extended from 0.3 to 34Ã¢Â mg/L, with a normal of 2.04Ã¢Â mg/L. 

The all out centralization of nitrogen close Bloomsburg somewhere in the range of 2002 and 2012 ran from 0.52 to 2.8Ã¢Â mg/L. The normal fixation was 1.212 ÃÂ mg/L. The smelling salts levels in the brook ran from under 0.02 ÃÂ mg/L to 0.06 ÃÂ mg/L, while the centralization of nitrates was in every case under 0.04Ã¢Â mg/L. The absolute convergence of phosphates extended from under 0.031Ã¢Â mg/L to 0.11Ã¢Â mg/L, while for phosphorus the figures ran from under 0.01Ã¢Â mg/L to 0.575 ÃÂ mg/L. 

The all out centralization of broke down solids close Bloomsburg ranges from under 2 to 166Ã¢Â mg/L. 

In many places on Fishing Creek, there isn't sufficient broken down aluminum to be poisonous, albeit East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum groupings of over 100Ã¢Â Ã®Åºg per liter, moving toward a deadly dimension for fish. Angling Creek itself and all its different tributaries have groupings of under 70Ã¢Â Ã®Åºg per liter. The focus is occasional: aluminum caught in solidified ground is discharged into the streams when the dirt defrosts. Subsequently, aluminum levels in the spring crest in March and April and drop to right around zero in the late spring. 

The centralization of calcium at the measuring station close Bloomsburg has gone from 5.5Ã¢Â mg/L to 26Ã¢Â mg/L, averaging 7.532Ã¢Â mg/L. The centralization of magnesium has extended from 1.5Ã¢Â mg/L to 6.7Ã¢Â mg/L, with a normal of 1.748Ã¢Â mg/L. 

There are five dams on Fishing Creek. The lowhead dam called Boone's Dam is the farthest downstream, in Montour Township. It is high and long. Further upstream is the Diverting Dam, a 2-foot (0.6-meter) high and 100-foot (31-meter) long dam in Bloomsburg. It was worked to control the adjacent Irondale heaters. A wide and high anonymous dam is on the rivulet further upstream, in Mount Pleasant Township. The highest dams are the wide and high Benton Dam and the wide and high Mill Dam, which are in Benton Township and Benton. Also, the Jonestown Dam is on the tributary Huntington Creek in Jonestown. This dam is high and wide. 

The most elevated water temperature is at West Creek, which can reach in the mid year. In Benton, Fishing Creek can reach in the late spring while Coles Creek just reaches . In the winter, the water in the primary stem is around , while in West Branch Fishing Creek it can drop to in the winter, making it the coldest stream in the watershed. At the measuring station close Bloomsburg, the temperature has gone from ; it was at its least on January 10, 2011. The most elevated temperature happened on August 3, 2006. The normal temperature in August was and the normal water temperature in January was . The temperature has arrived at the midpoint of around . 

The Fishing Creek watershed has been influenced by glaciation, which has left a frigid till close to the source and frosty outwash in the lower portions of the watershed. The watershed lies in two noteworthy land locales: the Deep Valley segment of the Allegheny Plateau and the Susquehanna Lowlands Section. The Allegheny Plateau lies in the upper ranges of the watershed and is portrayed by profound valleys and adjusted mountains with heights of around . The Susquehanna Lowlands segment is portrayed by direct edges of moderate rise and valleys less steep than those of the Deep Valley locale. There are likewise flood fields along the stream. Close to its mouth, it slices through Montour Ridge, and a basalt-containing segment of the Catskill Formation reaches out to the river's banks in Hemlock Township. Other shake arrangements along the banks incorporate the Clinton Formation, the Selena Formation, the Lower Helderburg Formation, and the Hamilton Formation. There is a terminal moraine, which crosses the stream close Benton. 

The bed of Fishing Creek contains red and dark colored shale in certain spots. Different pieces of the watershed lie over dark sandstone or aggregates. There are various stores of iron metal, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. The vast majority of the stone in the watershed, including the Trimmers Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, yet a portion of the northernmost tributaries have watersheds on shake from the Mississippian Period, for example, the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The spring is a freestone stream in spite of the fact that its water is colder than that of most eastern freestone streams. 

Territories along Fishing Creek contain pools pursued by riffles, which are additionally trailed by more pools. This arrangement of pools and riffles makes a perfect circumstance for fly-angling. The lower some portion of the brook frames one side of a triangle of low-lying land in western Bloomsburg, which floods seriously amid overwhelming downpours. 

The principle soil in the zone of Fishing Creek has a place with the Albrights arrangement, which contains a layer of sticky, ruddy dark colored, gravelly residue topsoil. Underneath this is a layer of yellowish-red, gravelly, silty earth topsoil, which reaches out to around subterranean and lies over a layer of equivalent parts of rock and silty dirt soil. Bedrock happens a few feet underneath the surface. The highest point of the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin arrangement in the watershed is dull dark colored residue soil with little bits of sandstone and shale. A subsoil of ruddy dark colored residue soil from subterranean is trailed by a layer of sticky dirt topsoil, underneath which is a bedrock of red shale. 

The Barbour arrangement happens close to the wellspring of the stream. It is finished with a brittle, layer of earthy red residue soil over a free subsoil of rosy dark colored topsoil with some rock. The top layer can without much of a stretch be entered by roots and water. Further down is a layer of ruddy dark colored rock and sand, which reaches out to or all the more underground. The Basher arrangement additionally happens along upper Fishing Creek. The top layer is a free, brittle, rosy dark colored sandy soil reaching out to underground, and the subsoil is a free, permeable, ruddy darker sandy topsoil with some rock, stretching out to underground. Let down, there is a layer of red sandy topsoil with some rock that reaches out from underground. 

The Pekin arrangement is found along Fishing Creek and its tributary Huntington Creek. The highest layer, a dim dark colored sediment topsoil that stretches out to underground, lies over a layer of darker residue soil with 10Ã¢Â percent rock broadening underground. The subsoil is mottled, dark colored, silty earth topsoil with cobbles and reaches out to underground. Bedrock happens at a profundity of underground. The Pekin soils close to the spring contain a greater number of cobbles than run of the mill Pekin soils. Soils of the Chen1ango-Pope-Holly arrangement have likewise been found along it. 

In 1914 the dirts of the Fishing Creek watershed were found to yield substantial amounts of homestead crops. Potatoes yielded 100 to 200 bushels for each section of land, corn 70 to 90 bushels for every section of land, oats 40 bushels for every section of land, wheat 20 to 30 bushels for each section of land, and feed one to two tons for every section of land. J.ÃÂ H. Fight's 1887 "History of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania" expressed that the Fishing Creek valley was prolific. 

Benthic green growth thickly spread the bed of Fishing Creek, their prevalence ascribed to releasing septic frameworks. At one area on the principle stem downstream of Grassmere Park, inclusion surpasses 60 percent. The prevailing algal creature on West Branch Fishing Creek close to the town of Elk Grove is "Cladophora". The green growth "Tetraspora" overwhelms the stretch of Fishing Creek for downstream of Grassmere Park, where it covers 80 percent of the riverbed. South of Pennsylvania Route 239's intersection of the brook, the predominant algal creatures are "Microspora", "Mougeotia", and "Spirogyra". In the fall, disintegrating green growth covers 50 percent of the riverbed. 

Thirty-six types of macroinvertebrates live in Fishing Creek. The most elevated amount of macroinvertebrate biodiversity on upper Fishing Creek is close Grassmere Park while the least is in Benton. The quantity of these living beings per square meter on Fishing Creek ranges from under 200 in Benton to almost 400 somewhere between Coles Creek and Benton. The most elevated thickness of them in the watershed happens at West Creek where there are among 600 and very nearly 900 for every m and the least thickness happens at a site on East Branch Fishing Creek, where there are around 100 for every m. 

Some of Fishing Creek is supplied by the Fishing Creek Sportsman's Association and contains populaces of rivulet trout, rainbow trout, and dark colored trout. Huge numbers of them are sizable; the biggest one got in Fishing Creek gauged and was long. All streams in the watershed are reasonable for trout home as per the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. A 1887 book expressed that Fishing Creek and its tributaries may have once been "bursting at the seams with trout". In the upper piece of the watershed, wild rivulet trout are most basic in West Branch Fishing Creek and fish all in all are least normal in East Branch Fishing Creek. West Creek has higher fish assorted variety than some other stream in the upper piece of the watershed and is likewise the main spot that is possessed by wild dark colored trout. What's more, sculpin and cutlips minnow have been seen in vast numbers in the brook and its tributaries. Less ordinarily watched fish in the upper piece of the watershed incorporate johnny darters, white suckers, and dark nosed dace. It is troublesome for fish to bring forth in the spring as a result of poor water quality close Benton, an absence of nourishment, and dry headwaters for part of the year. The fish decent variety in East Branch Fishing Creek and West Branch Fishing Creek is likewise fundamentally influenced by wordy fermentation, which is brought about by corrosive downpour falling in territories with no limestone in the bedrock. The fundamental stem encounters comparative issues however to a lesser degree, and the tributaries Coles Creek and West Creek experience the issues even less. 

Northern hardwood trees are regular in the Fishing Creek watershed. Ruffed grouse are basic along Little Fishing Creek and its tributaries north of Iola. There are populaces of Japanese knotweed, an intrusive plant, along the brook and its tributaries south of Pennsylvania Route 118. 

In 2011, the living space nature of upper Fishing Creek and its tributaries were appraised on a size of 1 to 200 (with a higher rating showing better tenability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. The greater part of this piece of the rivulet and its tributaries were appraised 166 or higher, which was viewed as ideal. The waters close to the mouths of West Branch and East Branch Fishing Creeks, and Fishing Creek close Benton, were appraised 113 to 160, considered problematic. A segment of West Creek was appraised 60Ã¢ÂÂ112, thought about peripheral. 

The most noteworthy Shannon Diversity Index of any stream in the Fishing Creek watershed is around 2.75, for West Branch Fishing Creek. This esteem is intently trailed by that of West Creek, which has a file of 2.5 to 2.6. The most minimal incentive in the watershed is that of East Branch Fishing Creek, which is around 1.2. The primary stem has a Shannon Diversity Index of 2.1 to 2.4, contingent upon the site. 

The Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association has proposed various strategies to monitor Fishing Creek and its tributaries. These incorporate planting riparian cradles, wiping out cracked septic frameworks, and shielding the region from water driven breaking. 

The Fishing Creek Watershed Association intends to open an open segment of the stream that extends for 6500 feet (1980 meters), with a recreation center of . There are different tracts of open property along the river, one of which, called the Power Dam, is upstream of Benton. It covers and stretches for 2900 feet (880 meters) of Fishing Creek, and contains the remaining parts of a solid dam. Another open region is the Benton Overlook into Benton, which covers and stretches for 2600 feet (790 meters) close to the brook. An open site at the Zaners Bridge in Zaner downstream from Stillwater covers along around 1000 feet (300 meters) of the stream and contains a deserted railroad level. 

The Grassmere Park Campground was set up in the mid 1900s on Fishing Creek. Further downstream, close Lightstreet, is Kocher Park, which possesses more than . Average exercises there incorporate kayaking, hound strolling, birdwatching and angling. 

The western piece of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13 is in a crevasse cut by West Branch Fishing Creek. These state amusement lands have a region of 50,000 sections of land and highlight many woodland streets and old levels. The climbing trail Waterfall Wonderland, which bears perspectives on Big, Twin, Lewis, and Sullivan Falls, is depicted as "a position of practically otherworldly magnificence" by Jeff Mitchell in his book "Climbing the Endless Mountains: Exploring the Wilderness of Northeastern Pennsylvania". The state diversion lands are less packed than the close-by Ricketts Glen State Park. 

The Jakey Hollow Natural Area is on a little tributary of Little Fishing Creek. It is close Mordansville and highlights old-development woods. The common zone is one of the littlest in Pennsylvania.
