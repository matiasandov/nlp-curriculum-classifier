U-5-class submarine (Austria-Hungary) 

The "U-5" class was a class of three submarines or U-pontoons that were worked by the Austro-Hungarian Navy ( or "K.u.K. Kriegsmarine") previously and amid World War I. The class was a piece of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's endeavors to aggressively assess three remote submarine structures. 

The structure of the pontoons depended on John Philip Holland's submarine plan and highlighted a solitary, tear body, which looked like the plan of present day atomic submarines. The class individuals were simply over long and dislodged surfaced and submerged. All were initially furnished with two bow torpedo tubes and could convey four torpedoes. The initial two vessels, "U-5" and "U-6", fabricated explicitly for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, to a similar plan as the United States C class submarine were in part developed in the United States and finished at Whitehead and Co. at Fiume. The third was totally built by Whitehead's at Fiume and obtained by Austria-Hungary to reinforce their U-vessel armada after the flare-up of World War I. 

Every one of the three pontoons had victories amid World War I; between them they sank five boats with a joined tonnage of 22,391. Furthermore they caught seven ships as prizes and harmed , a French battleship of 22,189 tons dislodging. Every one of the three pontoons were sunk amid the war, however "U-5", the lead vessel of the class, was raised and recommissioned after her sinking. After the war's end, "U-5", the main overcomer of the class, was surrendered to Italy as a war reparation and was separated in 1920. 

In 1904, in the wake of enabling the naval forces of different nations to pioneer submarine improvements, the Austro-Hungarian Navy requested the Austrian Naval Technical Committee (MTK) to deliver a submarine plan. The January 1905 plan created by the MTK and different structures put together by people in general as a major aspect of a structure rivalry were altogether dismissed by the Navy as impracticable. They rather picked to arrange two submarines every one of plans by Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland for an aggressive assessment. The two Holland submarines included the "U-5" class. The Navy approved two pontoons, "U-5" and "U-6", from Whitehead and Co. of Fiume in 1906. 

The "U-5" class was worked to a similar structure as the C class for the US Navy and was worked by Robert Whitehead's firm of Whitehead and Co. under permit from Holland and his organization, Electric Boat. Parts for the initial two Austrian vessels were made by the Electric Boat Company and amassed at Fiume, while the third pontoon was a theoretical private endeavor by Whitehead that neglected to discover a purchaser and was obtained by Austria-Hungary upon the episode of World War I. 

The "U-5"- class vessels had a solitary hulled structure with a tear shape that drag a solid likeness to present day atomic submarines. The vessels were simply over long and dislodged surfaced, and submerged. The torpedo tubes highlighted one of a kind, cloverleaf-molded structure brings forth that turned on a focal hub. The boats were controlled by twin 6-barrel gas motors while surfaced, yet experienced deficient ventilation which brought about incessant inebriation of the team. While submerged, they were pushed by twin electric engines. 

The initial two pontoons, "U-5" and "U-6", were requested by the Austro-Hungarian Navy for assessment and were mostly collected in the United States, transported to Fiume, and bolted together by Whitehead and Co., which, creator Edwin Sieche reports, "caused a great deal of inconvenience". "U-5" was propelled in February 1909 and was followed in June by the dispatch of "U-6". The two pontoons were charged by April 1910. 

The third vessel, initially named "SS-3", was based on hypothesis completely at Whitehead's in Fiume. The pontoon's plan highlighted enhancements in the electrical and mechanical frameworks. Gibson and Prendergast report that, when constructed, "SS-3" was fueled by electric engines for both surface and submerged running. At the point when the surface execution of the electric engines demonstrated disillusioning in preliminaries, "SS-3"s power-plant was revamped to coordinate the gas/electric mix utilized in "U-5" and "U-6". "SS-3" was propelled in March 1911 and was offered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but since the assessment of the initial two "U-5"- class vessels was as yet in progress, they declined to buy. 

As assembled, the "U-5"- class pontoons were furnished with two bow torpedo tubes and could convey a supply of four torpedoes. By 1915, all had gotten a 3.7Ã¢Â cm/23 (1.5Ã¢Â in) deck firearm. 

"U-5" and "U-6" were both authorized into the Austro-Hungarian Navy by April 1910, and filled in as preparing vessels through 1914, making upwards of ten preparing travels for every month. Amid their initial years, each pontoon was shown to a remote maritime designation; "U-5" to a Peruvian separation in 1911, "U-6" to a Norwegian gathering in 1910. Toward the start of World War I in August 1914, "U-5" and "U-6" contained portion of the operational U-pontoon armada of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. 

In the three years after "SS-3"s March 1911 dispatch, Whitehead's endeavored to pitch the vessel to the naval forces of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy dismissed an idea for the second time. With the episode of war, be that as it may, the Austro-Hungarian Navy acquired the unsold submarine to rapidly reinforce its armada. Albeit temporarily appointed as "U-7", she was charged as "U-12" in August 1914. 

By late December 1914, every one of the three of the "U-5"- class vessels were based at the maritime base at Cattaro and all partook in battle watches. Between the three pontoons, they sank five boats with a joined tonnage of 22,391, caught seven ships, and harmed one man of war. "U-6" was the most disastrous, sinking a solitary ship of ; "U-5" was the best, sinking four boats with of a joined , including the French heavily clad cruiser . "U-12" harmed, yet did not sink, the biggest ship torpedoed by any of the "U-5" class when she hit the French warship on 21 December 1914. 

Of the three pontoons of the class, just "U-5" endure the war unblemished. "U-12" was sunk with the loss of all hands when she hit a mine close Venice in August 1915, while "U-6" was abandoned by her group in May 1916 subsequent to getting to be caught in an enemy of submarine net that was a piece of the Otranto Barrage. "U-5" herself sank in the wake of hitting an Austro-Hungarian mine amid a preparation work out, yet was raised, fixed and recommissioned before the war's end. "U-5" was surrendered to Italy as a war reparation and rejected in 1920. 

SM "U-5" was set down in April 1907 and propelled in February 1909. She was appointed into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in April 1910, and filled in as a preparation boatÃ¢ÂÂsometimes making upwards of ten travels a monthÃ¢ÂÂthrough the start of the First World War in 1914. The submarine scored the vast majority of her wartime triumphs amid the primary year of the war while under the order of Georg Ritter von Trapp. The French protected cruiser , soaked in April 1915, was the biggest ship sunk by "U-5". In May 1917, "U-5" hit a mine and sank with the loss of six men. She was raised, revamped, and recommissioned, however sank no more ships. Toward the finish of the war, "U-5" was surrendered to Italy as a war reparation, and rejected in 1920. On the whole, "U-5" sank four boats totaling 21,604 tons. 

SM "U-6" was set down in February 1908 and propelled the next June. She filled in as a preparation vessel after her July 1910 appointing into the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She served in that limit through the start of World War I in 1914, making upwards of ten preparing travels a month. "U-6" scored just a single wartime achievement, sinking a French destroyer in March 1916. In May that equivalent year, she ended up trapped in against submarine netting sent as a component of the Otranto Barrage. Experiencing harsh criticism from wanderers running the nets, "U-6" was relinquished and sunk. Every last bit of her crew members were safeguarded and were held in imprisonment through the finish of the war. 

SM "U-12" was based on theory by Whitehead and Co. of Fiume under the name "SS-3". She was set down in 1909 and propelled in March 1911 and highlighted enhancements in the electrical and mechanical frameworks from the Holland structure of her more seasoned sister pontoons, "U-5" and "U-6". Whitehead's taken a stab at selling "SS-3" to a few distinct naval forces, yet she was at long last purchased by the Austro-Hungarian Navy after the flare-up of World War I, regardless of having been dismissed twice previously. She was charged as "U-12" in August 1914. She sank just a single ship amid the war, a Greek payload transport in May 1915, however had prior caught six Montenegrin cruising vessels as prizes in March. "U-12" likewise harmed, however did not sink, the French war vessel in December 1914. While hunting down focuses in the region of Venice in August 1915, "U-12" struck a mine that brushed her stern off, and sank with all hands, turning into the first Austro-Hungarian submarine soaked in the war. Her disaster area was rescued the following year by the Italians, who entombed the assemblages of "U-12"s crew members in a Venetian burial ground.
