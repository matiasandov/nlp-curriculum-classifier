The ship was dispatched in 1892 and filled in as the leader of the Channel Fleet for the following five years. She was exchanged to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1897 and returned home in 1902, and was quickly doled out as a coast watch send before she started a protracted refit in 1903Ã¢ÂÂ1904. "Imperial Sovereign" was decreased to save in 1905 and was removed from administration in 1909. The ship was sold for scrap four years after the fact and in this manner separated in Italy. 

The plan of the "Imperial Sovereign"- class ships was gotten from that of the war vessels, significantly broadened to improve seakeeping and to give space to an optional deadly implement as in the previous war vessels. The boats dislodged at typical burden and at profound burden. They had a length between perpendiculars of and a general length of , a light emission and a draft of . Their team comprised of 670 officers and appraisals. 

The "Imperial Sovereign"s were controlled by a couple of three-chamber, vertical triple-extension steam motors, each driving one shaft. Her Humphrys and Tennant motors were intended to create a sum of and a most extreme speed of utilizing steam furnished by eight barrel shaped boilers with constrained draft. "Imperial Sovereign" was the principal ship of the class to be finished, and was put through a protracted arrangement of steam preliminaries of which just a couple of sets of figures have endure. She made more than eight hours from utilizing ordinary draft and more than three hours from utilizing constrained draft. A portion of her heater tubes were seen to break and hole under the weights required; subsequently, the Navy chose not to drive the boilers of the "Regal Sovereign" class past 11,000 ihp to anticipate comparable harm. The boats conveyed a limit of coal, which gave them a scope of at a speed of .

The "Regal Sovereign"- class ships mounted seven 14-inch (356Ã¢Â mm) torpedo tubes, albeit "Regal Sovereign" had four of hers expelled in 1903Ã¢ÂÂ04. 

The "Illustrious Sovereign"s' defensive layer conspire was like that of the "Trafalgar"s, as the waterline belt of compound shield just ensured the zone between the barbettes. The belt and transverse bulkheads thick shut off the finishes of the belt. Over the belt was a strake of Harvey protection shut off by angled bulkheads. The barbettes were secured by compound covering, running in thickness from and the casemates for the 6-inch firearms were ensured by an equivalent thickness of protective layer. The thicknesses of the defensive layer deck extended from . The dividers of the forward conning tower were thick and the behind conning tower was secured by 3-inch plates.
