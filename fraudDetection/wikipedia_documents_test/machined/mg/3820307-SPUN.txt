In 1991, "Subspecies" turned into the primary American film to be recorded in Bucharest, Romania. Chief Ted Nicolaou was at first uneasy about shooting on area in Romania, however amid a four-day area scout he came to cherish the area because of the free rein he had over the antiquated vestiges and forest region. Other Transylvanian territories would be utilized for all "Subspecies" films, with explicit area shootings at Hunedoara, BraÄÂov, and Sinaia. In spite of the fact that, the leftovers of socialism left in the nation, alongside social contrasts and the general issues that go with film preparations loaned to a troublesome encounter for the team while shooting the primary "Subspecies" film. 

The subspecies animals, which were made from Radu's blood, initially started as neighborhood Romanian men in elastic suits. The men were shot on over-scaled sets to reproduce the smaller than expected size of the animals. The exhibitions of the Romanian men, alongside the structure of the elastic suits, caused chief Ted Nicolaou to reevaluate his methodology. Nicolaou acquired illustrator David W. Allen to help him in making "progressively supernatural" looking subspecies animals. Allen experienced the majority of the film that contained the Romanian additional items in their elastic suits with the film's manager so as to discover usable film when the men enter the scene. Allen would utilize the detached film to build up another foundation for the enlivened animals he would later make. Allen made two manikin types, showed before a bluescreen: a stop-movement manikin and a bar manikin. Every one of the manikin types were made out of froth elastic, and held comparable skeletal frameworks. A few contrasts between the two sorts incorporate pressure filled joints for the stop-movement manikin, while the pole manikin was looser. The adaptability of the pole manikin took into consideration quicker developments, which were required periodically for constant taping. 

For "Bloodstone" and "Bloodlust", Wayne Toth and Norman Cabrera went ahead board to make the uncommon make-up impacts for the movies; they additionally pulled twofold obligation making and playing out the music, close by Romanian performers, for a part of "Bloodstone". The restricted spending that Toth and Cabrera needed to work constrained them to utilize any area they could discover so as to apply the make-up to the performing artists, as they didn't have a different workstation. Make-up trailers would be made in neighborhood inhabitant's homes, cavern openings, within vehicles, or simply sitting in favor of the street. To make Radu's face, Toth and Cabrera connected four separate prosthetic pieces to Anders Hove's brow, left and right cheek, and his jaw. A restorative make-up is connected over his whole face to help hide those four prosthetics. This was a similar procedure utilized in the first "Subspecies" film, despite the fact that Toth and Cabrera confess to tweaking the shading of Radu's skin. One noteworthy switch to the make-up procedure was to Radu's hands. In the first film, Hove needed to wear singular apparatuses on every one of his fingers, however to reduce the time expected to apply the make-up, Toth and Cabrera made a couple of prosthetic gloves that Hove could slip staring him in the face. For "Mummy", Radu's sorceress mother, a headpiece was thrown from Pamela Gordon, which incorporated her shoulders too. After the make-up was connected to give the cast a "dry" and "preserved" appearance, it was slipped over Gordon's head leaving just her face appearing. From that point, Toth and Cabrera connected a different face prosthetic. The facial machine gave Gordon almost no ability to see, having just a solitary eye cut for her left eye. The group needed to escort her around sets so she would not harm herself. Gordon was given a couple of dentures to wear, just as some prosthetic gloves like what Hove wore. The remainder of Gordon's body was hung in garments to hide it. 

"Culture Cartel" pundit Mike Bracken trusted the story was "to a great extent clichÄÅ¡d", combined with "awful acting" with respect to Watson and the female cast, yet praised the authenticity Nicolaou made by shooting on area in RomaniaÃ¢ÂÂusing Romanian occupants for littler jobs in the filmÃ¢ÂÂas well as the way that the film does not "pay attention to itself as well", making it "progressively fun" than Francis Ford Coppola's "Dracula". "Cold Fusion Video's" Nathan Shumate reverberated Bracken's sentiment on the "validness" made from the Romanian finishing and performing artists that gave "the vibe of verisimilitude", however condemned the stop-movement subspecies as being "immaterial to the primary activity", and the story as a "general absence of direness". Richard Scheib, a commentator for sci-fi, loathsomeness, and dream survey site "Moria", felt the first film "demonstrated guarantee" when it endeavored to go "back to the old stories underlying foundations of vampirism"; he likewise loved the true inclination from shooting in Romania, yet felt the constrained spending plan limited the film from being persuading, with David Allen's stop-movement subspecies animals being a mistake. When he got an opportunity to survey "Bloodstone", Scheib felt the spin-off conveyed "vampire clichÄÅ¡s", yet once more "indicated guarantee" with its inventive make-up effectsÃ¢ÂÂspecifically the staking of Stefan, the reattachment of Radu's head by the subspecies animals, the appearance of MummyÃ¢ÂÂas well as the enhanced visualizations of Radu's shadow stalking Michelle through town, which gave Scheib a feeling of "Nosferatu". Another analysis from Scheib was with the supplanting of Laura Tate with Denice Duff; Scheib portrays Duff as "disguised and apprehensive", rather than the expansion of Melanie Shatner's character, Rebecca Morgan, whom he arranges as "alert and smart". 

DVDschlock composed that the film arrangement "figure out how to give an edge of terrible assitude to its vampires", and that "each engages in its own privilege and advances the "Subspecies" story one more advance past the last one... until at long last being beaten over the head by a scoop with the stinky "Vampire Journals"". In an audit by LaserDisc, it was felt that one consistency through the arrangement was Radu, whose villainy is "adequately epitomized" by Anders Hove. LaserDisc likewise trusted that the continuations supported the diversion esteem through their insightful utilization of sensuality, gore and on-area setting. 

In 1991, Full Moon collaborated with Eternity Comics to create comic books arrangement for a bunch of Full Moon's titles. Among these funnies was a "Subspecies" arrangement that filled in as a prequel to the principal film. The title kept running as a four-issue small scale arrangement.
