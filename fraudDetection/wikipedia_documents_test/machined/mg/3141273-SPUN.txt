FlÄÄ¾m Line 

The FlÄÄ¾m Line () is a long railroad line among Myrdal and FlÄÄ¾m in Aurland, Norway. A branch line of the Bergen Line, it goes through the valley of FlÄÄ¾msdalen and associates the mainline with Sognefjord. The line's height distinction is ; it has ten stations, twenty passages and one extension. The greatest angle is 5.5 percent (1:18). As a result of its lofty slope and beautiful nature, the FlÄÄ¾m Line is presently only a traveler administration and has turned into the third-most visited vacation spot in Norway. 

Development of the line began in 1924, with the line opening in 1940. It permitted the region of Sogn access to Bergen and Oslo by means of the Bergen Line. Electric footing was taken into utilization in 1944; at first El 9 trains were utilized, and from 1982 El 11. Until 1991, the train associated with a ship administration from FlÄÄ¾m to Gudvangen. In 1992, cargo administrations were ended, and because of low ticket costs and high working costs, the line was about shut. In 1998, FlÄÄ¾m Utvikling took over advertising and ticket deal for the line, costs were vigorously expanded and El 17 trains were presented. The trains remain worked by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), while the line itself is claimed and worked by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. 

The FlÄÄ¾m Line keeps running from Myrdal on the Bergen Line to FlÄÄ¾m. Myrdal Station is situated in a mountain go at above mean ocean level (AMSL), while FlÄÄ¾m is situated at AMSL. The line's greatest inclination is 5.5 percent, and of the line's have at any rate 2.8 percent slope. The line has standard measure and a base bend sweep of , and is the steepest standard-check railroad in Europe. Greatest allowed speed upwards is , while it is downhill. The line has eight stops, twenty passages and one scaffold. The line is energized at utilizing overhead wire, and is outfitted with Global System for Mobile Communications Ã¢ÂÂ Railway (GSM-R), however needs unified traffic control (CTC). The framework is possessed and worked by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. 

At Myrdal Station, the FlÄÄ¾m Line keeps running a similar way as the trains towards Oslo, however promptly begins running downwards into the FlÄÄ¾msdalen valley. The initial segment of the line goes through snow covers and a few short passages. Vatnahalsen Station is situated from Myrdal, at AMSL. The line at that point goes through a horseshoe bend and the Vatnahalsen Tunnel. It leaves the passage onto a fake rack on a bluff which falls a few hundred meters down. Reinunga Station is situated from Myrdal and at rise. It is trailed by Kjosfossen Station, from Myrdal and AMSL, which fills no other need than enabling travelers to take a gander at the cascade Kjosfossen. 

The line at that point goes through the NÄÄ¾li Tunnel, the longest hanging in the balance. Toward the finish of the passage lies KÄÄ¾rdal Station, generally serving the homestead farthest up in the valley. The station is from Myrdal and AMSL. On the opposite side of the valley is Trodlatoppen, the site of a few torrential slides each year. The line at that point goes through the Blomhelleer Tunnel, after which it comes to Blomheller Station, from Myrdal and AMSL. The railroad at that point crosses the stream FlÄÄ¾mselvi and goes through a progression of short passages. 

At from Myrdal, the line comes to Berekvam Station, situated at AMSL. It is the main station to have a passing circle and accordingly the main area on hold where trains can meet. Since the station is unmanned and needs CTC, crossing must be performed utilizing banners at day and lights during the evening, set by work force who travel from Myrdal or FlÄÄ¾m. At HÄÂ¸ga, the railroad crosses the stream once more, this time by the waterway running in a passage under the tracks. The following station is Dalsbotn Station, situated from Myrdal and at AMSL. Just before achieving the keep going passage, the long Furuberget Tunnel, the line goes by the cascade Rjoandefossen, which with a vertical drop is one of the line's principle attractions. 

After HÄÄ¾reina Station, situated from Myrdal at height, the valley broadens and changes character, getting to be compliment and with more vegetation. Subsequent to passing Lunden Station, from Myrdal and at height, the line achieves the end, FlÄÄ¾m Station. Situated on Aurlandsfjord, a part of the Sognefjord, FlÄÄ¾m has 400 occupants and is almost only a visitor region, highlighting in addition to other things an inn and a journey send port. The station likewise has a railroad exhibition hall committed to the FlÄÄ¾m Line. 

Plans to assemble a railroad to interface Norway's two biggest urban areas, Oslo and Bergen, were propelled by Andreas Tanberg GlÄÂ¸ersen in 1871. He suggested that the line run by means of Hallingdal and Voss and incorporate two short branch lines which would associate with the two noteworthy fjord frameworks in the region, Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord. The restricted measure Voss Line from Bergen to Voss opened in 1883, and the Bergen Line was finished as standard check in 1909. Amid the development of the Bergen Line, the way that kept running up FlÄÄ¾msdalen was overhauled by NSB to enable access to the territory around Myrdal. This street was utilized by steed carriages and later autos, turning into a vital access course to the region, however it was excessively steep and tight for substantial vehicles. The Hardanger Line, which associated the Bergen Line to Hardangerfjord, opened in 1935, and was the district's first railroad to open with electric footing. 

The principal designing studies for the FlÄÄ¾m Line were performed in 1893. It brought about a proposition for a restricted check railroad which would be long. The majority of the railroad would be worked as a grip rail line with a 2.5 percent angle, albeit some portion of it would be a rack rail line with a slope of 10.0 percent. It was at the time assessed to cost 3.3 million Norwegian krone (NOK). In 1904, a drastically extraordinary course to Sognefjord was proposed: a long grip line from Voss to Gudvangen by means of Stalheim. It was assessed to cost NOKÃÂ 3.5 million, however was considered by neighborhood legislators to be mediocre compared to the FlÄÄ¾m elective. A third option was a consolidated tramway and funicular, which would be worked among Myrdal and Fretheim. It was evaluated to cost NOKÃÂ 800,000, yet NSB was worried that the proposition's light moving stock would not be adequate to work through snow amid the winter. Evaluated traffic for the FlÄÄ¾m Line was 22,000 yearly travelers. 

As both different choices were disposed of, agreement steadily developed for the FlÄÄ¾m elective, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County prescribed this proposition. New plans from NSB condemned the blend of rack and grip railroad, and rather proposed an ordinary attachment line the whole distance. Designer Ferdinand Bjerke ventured out to Continental Europe to consider a few consolidated railroads. He distributed a fundamental report in 1911, which prescribed a bond railroad, in spite of the fact that he additionally felt the requirement for a nitty gritty investigation of a rack rail line. His last report was done in 1913, and in spite of the fact that it suggested bond, it called attention to that the line's ability would be littler than anticipated and that expenses would be multiple times as highÃ¢ÂÂNOKÃÂ 5.5 million. The plans were endorsed by the Ministry of Labor and NSB's primary board in 1915. 

The plans were endorsed by Parliament in 1916. Be that as it may, the choice concerning specialized details was not taken by Parliament until 1923, when it chose that the line was to be electric. The line was then assessed to cost NOKÃÂ 14.5 millionÃ¢ÂÂthe increment brought about by swelling amid the First World WarÃ¢ÂÂof which NOKÃÂ 1.2 million was to be paid by the neighborhood governments. The line was to have tracks which weighed 25Ã¢Â kilograms per meter (50Ã¢Â lb/ft). The bend span was set to least , albeit extraordinarily was allowed. The steepest allowed slope was 5.5 percent (1:18). 

In 1915, the principal proposition was propelled for utilizing a transport administration as an option in contrast to the train. This was rejected in light of the fact that transports were not ready to give the solace and dependability of a train. The thought was proposed again in 1922 by the chief of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the most grounded adversaries to the transport elective was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who expressed that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid piece of the provincial financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they get a branch line to the Sognefjord. 

The 1920s saw high swelling and substantial open shortfalls. A few open boards of trustees were made exclusively to cut expenses. One such proposition was to construct a street to FlÄÄ¾m, with the proposition being driven by Hans Kristian Seip, who was executive of Bergen Public Road Administration. In 1925, after the arrangement of Mowinckel's First Cabinet, it was suggested that the railroad be worked as a street, and the tracks laid later. One of NSB's board individuals proposed rather assembling a suspended railroad. The designs to drop the railroad were halted as a result of parliamentarian support for the railroad. Some portion of the political help was on the grounds that there was concession to a national railroad plan, and evacuating portions of it would disturb the geological trade off. Be that as it may, Parliament voted to decrease the quantity of middle of the road stations to one, which would enable trains to meet at Berekvam. The cost putting something aside for a street was assessed at 30 percent. The issue of a street was taken up in another vote in Parliament in 1927, however was again dismissed. 

The organization office for the development was built up in 1923 and was until 1935 situated at Voss. In that period, development was driven by Peter Bernhard Kristian Lahlum, who was likewise in charge of the Hardanger Line. After the Hardanger Line was finished, Lahlum resigned, and the workplace was moved to FlÄÄ¾m where duty was taken over by Adolph M. B. Kielland. To begin with, there were 120 men chipping away at the development, despite the fact that this immediately expanded to 220. The numbers vacillated among that and as low as 80, in spite of the fact that hit an unequaled high of 280 individuals in 1937. To house the representatives, eight sleeping quarters were fabricated. Among the principal things manufactured were lodging and station structures, which could then be utilized by individuals taking a shot at the development. The nearby economy was invigorated by ranchers being paid for transport. Utilizing ponies, they would transport vacationers by day and building materials by night. The challenge was furious, bringing about battles for clients, in spite of the fact that it quieted down after traffic police were presented. 

In 1924, there was an avalanche at HÄÂ¸ga, covering the zone made arrangements for the railroad. The region was made of phyllite and was the topographically most unsteady zone on the course. The underlying reaction was to get ready for a passage past the region, yet this was immediately dismissed as a result of the high cost. Rather, the line was moved further far from the mountain side. Different slides amid development incorporated a torrential slide close Store Reppa on 10 February 1925, which kept up to of earth. In April 1925, an avalanche occurred above Berekvam. On 8 February 1928, a torrential slide did some harm to the option to proceed close NÄÄ¾li. 

The passages were the most troublesome and tedious piece of development. Of the twenty passages, machines were utilized for the NÄÄ¾li and Vatnahalsen TunnelsÃ¢ÂÂthe rest were worked by hand. Hand-development was finished by boring up to through the stone, filling the openings with explosive and impacting. Development of passages began in 1924 and the main passage was finished in 1926; the last passage was finished in 1935. By and large, burrowing continued at somewhere in the range of 116 and 180 worker hours for each meter (35Ã¢ÂÂ55 hr/ft). The work caused passing or deep rooted respiratory issues through silicosis brought about by breathing in the smoke. There were two lethal mishaps, one of every 1925 and one 1938, both identified with passage work. 

Ten stations were worked for the line, including a noteworthy move up to Myrdal and port offices at FlÄÄ¾m. Myrdal Station was given diverts extra structures to serve exchanging travelers, with the redesigns costing NOKÃÂ 0.5 million. Breikvam was the main spot on-course which got a passing circle. FlÄÄ¾m Station cost NOKÃÂ 0.8 million and was structured during the 1930s NSB basic wooden functionalist style, like what is found on the Nordland Line and the SÄÂ¸rland Line. Different stations got little, wooden structures with a sitting area, just as a space for load at Vatnahalsen, HÄÄ¾reina and Dalsbotn. 

Laying of tracks began in 1936, and was helped by two steam trains. The work began at Myrdal and came to Reinunga the principal year, Kjosfossen Tunnel the second year and the Blomheller Tunnel in 1939. The primary train to work on an ordinary calendar was in October 1939, when a cargo train among Myrdal and Berekvam ran three times each week. Be that as it may, this administration was halted before the month's over. With the German control of Norway in 1940, work began later in the season, yet the German experts needed to accelerate the work to make the line usable for steam prepares that equivalent year. They planned the line for fruition in 1942. Track laying work was quickened by expanding the quantity of laborers from 58 to 195. Normal cargo activity on the FlÄÄ¾m Line began on 1 August 1940, though restricted to a hub heap of . At the time there were four trains every day, two toward every path. 

Traveler trains began running on 10 February 1941, additionally with two trains toward every path every day. Travel time was 65 minutes downhill and 80 minutes tough. The official name of the line was chosen by the service on 26 June 1941. From 1 May 1942, Rolf Aksnes took over as head engineer after Kielland. Amid development of the Bergen Line in 1898, the upper piece of Kjosfossen had been developed with a hydroelectric power station. Another power station was worked there, and taken into utilization on 27 October 1944. Worked by KvÄÅrner and Norsk Elektrisk and Brown Boveri (NEBB), it had a power yield of . 

The expenses for the task finished at NOKÃÂ 26,651,900, of which NOKÃÂ 22.0 million was for the railroad. This complete included NOKÃÂ 2.3 million for a power station and NOKÃÂ 1.2 million for a ship quay at FlÄÄ¾m. The biggest expense was for earthwork, which finished at NOKÃÂ 9.1 million; other real expenses were NOKÃÂ 2.4 million for moving stock, NOKÃÂ 1.6 million for stations, NOKÃÂ 1.2 for tracks, NOKÃÂ 1.5 million for snow security and NOKÃÂ 675,000 for zap. 

Normal activity with electric trains was presented on 25 November 1944. In any case, Class 64 railcars were utilized. NSB had initially intended to utilize electric different units, yet changed the plans amid the war and rather chose to utilize trains and vehicles. The Class 64 trains stayed in administration on the FlÄÄ¾m Line until May 1947. They were typically utilized on the Hardanger Line, however were consistently reclaimed into utilization on the FlÄÄ¾m Line when the traffic was at its most reduced. 

NSB requested three El 9 trains from Thune on 4 October 1940. The units were conveyed in 1942, with the electrical parts from NEBB and the transformers and controllers from Per Kure. A deferral was brought about by besieging of Per Kure by the obstruction. The trains were custom-worked for the precarious inclinations on the FlÄÄ¾m and Hardanger Lines, and were conveyed with a pivot heap of and a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement. The trains gauged and the most extreme allowed train weight was . In the event that the trains were to stop at KÄÄ¾rdal, the weight was additionally restricted to . 

At first there were three trains on the Bergen Line toward every path every day, so just a solitary train was important on the FlÄÄ¾m Line. From 1949 there were two trains on the FlÄÄ¾m Line and from 1955 each of the three were utilized there. Five traveler autos in aluminum were conveyed by StrÄÂ¸mmens VÄÅrksted. The expense of the three trains and five vehicles was NOKÃÂ 2.4 million. 

The railroad rapidly observed an expansion in rush hour gridlock, with a normal 11 percent yearly increment from the opening until the mid-1950s. To some extent to enable access to Kjosfossen, Kjosfossen Station was opened in 1951. By at that point, ridership had balanced out at 115,000 individuals for every year. A critical segment of the traffic comprised of vacationers, to some degree from voyage ships docked in FlÄÄ¾m. In the last 50% of the decade, NSB propelled the Norway in a Nutshell bundle, which incorporated a ride on the FlÄÄ¾m Line. A dozing vehicle was presented on the night train among FlÄÄ¾m and Oslo in 1958. It made three excursions toward every path every week amid the late spring season, and accomplished a 84 percent inhabitance rate. That year, Breikvam Station ended up unmanned. Traffic stayed stable all through the 1960s, while enthusiasm for building up the railroad for visitors declined and neighborhood lawmakers expressed that a street was expected to pull in vacationers to Aurland. The power station was moved up to in 1969. 

In 1969, ridership expanded by 10 percent and by 12 percent the next year. In 1971 and 1972, it saw a 20-percent increaseÃ¢ÂÂthe last speaking to the principal year with InterRail tickets. By then the yearly ridership had achieved 175,000. In 1970, an extra train was positioned at FlÄÄ¾m, which made it conceivable to travel a round outing among FlÄÄ¾m and Bergen in multi day. Somewhere in the range of 1975 and 1982, NSB began running direct trains among ÄÂl and FlÄÄ¾m. In 1978, the morning express trains on the Bergen Line began halting at Myrdal, enabling better access for visitors to the FlÄÄ¾m Line. Traffic expanded further until 1980, when it hit 200,000, and after that stayed stable as the decade progressed. 

At the point when the line opened, it got a ton of cargo traffic for the development of a power station in ÄÂrdal. From the opening, the FlÄÄ¾m Line was the quickest methods for transport among Sogn and both Oslo and Bergen, and most post was additionally sent through the line. From 1977, the vast majority of the post was rather sent by truck by means of Gol, and just post from Aurland went through the railroad. Different items sent by the line were milk to the dairy in Voss, which ended in 1983, just as natural product. Incomplete burdens saw an extensive increment amid the 1960s, after NSB and the ship administrator Fylkesbaatane I Sogn og Fjordane collaborated to send bundles through FlÄÄ¾m to Oslo and Bergen. FlÄÄ¾m had a few landings until 1973, when Linjegods was built up. Following a rearrangement, the quantity of calls was decreased to once every week. Cargo volume fell further amid the 1980s; an endeavor in 1978 to constrain the three noteworthy wholesalers Linjegods, Firda Billag and Sogn Billag to course traffic through the FlÄÄ¾m Line fizzled. 

Amid the 1970s, NSB began the way toward finding a swap for the El 9. New trains would cost NOKÃÂ 20 million, and the organization considered it to be unlikely to put such a great amount in a minor branch line. NSB had likewise closed its away-with-the-steam program, and thusly had an absence of trains when all is said in done. On the off chance that another class of trains was to be assembled, it would need to fulfill more than the necessities for the FlÄÄ¾m Line, so NSB rather begun researching whether any of the more seasoned models could be utilized. Tests were performed in 1971 and 1973 with El 11, worked somewhere in the range of 1951 and 1964, and El 13, worked somewhere in the range of 1957 and 1966. Nor was viewed as ideal: El 11 permitted the train weight to increment to , however the train had the means for the voltage controller and the recompense set for too high speeds. El 13 had rheostatic brakes, which were not reasonable for the angle; the trains were additionally more qualified for mainline administration and would in this way not be organized for branch lines. 

In 1972, the FlÄÄ¾m Line was reconstructed to permit a pivot heap of . El 11 was picked as El 9's substitution in the mid-1970s, yet it was not until November 1980 that El 11.2098 began being remade for its new administration. Redesigns included rheostatic brakes and electromagnetic brakes, new speed estimation and bend lights. The train was taken into utilization on the FlÄÄ¾m Line in June 1982. After a year, El 11.2092 was additionally taken into utilization after a comparable remake. El 9 stayed in sporadic use until 1989. Class 69 electric various units were taken into utilization beginning on 10 August 1982. These had been allotted to Bergen District for use on the Bergen Commuter Rail, and were additionally utilized on the immediate trains among Bergen and FlÄÄ¾m. The primary weakness with the class was the little windows, as the trains were intended for suburbanite traffic as opposed to touring. 

In 1990, a quick ship administration was presented in Sogn with direct administrations to Bergen. In 1991, the Gudvangen Tunnel opened, giving FlÄÄ¾m a street association with Gudvangen and ending the ship administration. NSB was losing cash at stake, to some extent due to extremely low income per rider. A similar ticket costs were charged as somewhere else, in light of an expense for every kilometer; the low speed joined with a great deal of free voyagers utilizing InterRail tickets gave little income. From 1991, the ticket costs were expanded as though the line was longer. In 1992, another station incorporating was taken with use at FlÄÄ¾m. Amid the 1990s, X10 passenger trains from Stockholm were obtained amid the mid year for additional trains. These trains had bigger windows than Class 69, giving better perspectives. A gallery and documentation focus was set up in 1995. Initially situated in an addition of Fretheim Hotel, it moved in 1999 to the old station working at FlÄÄ¾m. 

In March 1997, NSB reported that they had plans to privatize the tasks of the line from 1998. The obligation regarding setting the timetable, offering tickets and advertising was exchanged to FlÄÄ¾m Utvikling, a recently settled organization that NSB possessed 49 percent of, and Aurland Ressursutvikling 51 percent. The last was claimed by Aurland Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Aurland Sparebank, a nearby bank. FlÄÄ¾m Utvikling likewise took over duty regarding other the travel industry related exercises in FlÄÄ¾m, for example, port offices. NSB would at present work the trains, and FlÄÄ¾m Utvikling would pay NSB the expense of running the trains, yet keep the benefits from the ticket deals. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, which had been set up in 1996 and had assumed control over the obligation regarding framework, held responsibility for line itself. FlÄÄ¾m Utvikling likewise begun structure a voyage deliver terminal at FlÄÄ¾m, so visitors could walk aground and legitimately to the trains. 

With the difference in possession, NSB additionally chose to supplant the maturing El 11 with El 17. The trains had been conveyed in 1987 and were expected for express train administration, yet had been tormented with specialized issues and were not viewed as sufficiently dependable to work as single trains. The six most current trains of the class were painted in another green attire and marked as FlÄÄ¾msbana as opposed to NSB. More established B3 carriages were redesigned, given new display windows and painted in a similar shading plan and taken into utilization hanging in the balance. In October 2000, NSB sold its offers in FlÄÄ¾m Utvikling to Aurland Ressursutvikling. The line got GSM-R from 1 May 2005. That year, NÄÅrÄÂ¸yfjord, the neighboring fjord to where FlÄÄ¾m is found, was recorded as a World Heritage Site. 

The line is exclusively served by a traveler arranged administration worked by the Norwegian State Railways for the benefit of FlÄÄ¾m Utvikling. From May through September, there are nine or ten takeoffs toward every path every day. In the remainder of the year, there are four. Charges don't pursue the ordinary passages for NSB and are significantly higher than on other train courses. InterRail tickets are not substantial with the expectation of complimentary travel, however give a 30 percent markdown. Travel time differs somewhere in the range of 50 and 59 minutes between the end stations. In 2007, the line was the third-most visited vacation spot in Norway and conveyed 547,000 travelers in 2010. The administration is given by pushÃ¢ÂÂpull trains comprising of an El 17 at each end and with B3 carriages. The trains were worked by Henschel in 1987, with electrical gear from NEBB. They have a power yield of and a Bo'Bo' wheel plan.
