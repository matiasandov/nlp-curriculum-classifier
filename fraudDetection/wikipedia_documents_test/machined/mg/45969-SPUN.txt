Crawford at that point marked a film contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925; her vocation would traverse decades, studios and debates. 

During the 1930s, Crawford's acclaim matched, and later outlived, that of MGM associates Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo. Crawford frequently played dedicated young ladies who discovered sentiment and achievement. These characters and stories were generally welcomed by Depression-period gatherings of people, and were mainstream with ladies. Crawford wound up a standout amongst Hollywood's most unmistakable motion picture stars, and one of the most generously compensated ladies in the United States. In 1945 she featured in "Mildred Pierce" and won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She would proceed to get Best Actress assignments for "Had" (1947) and "Unexpected Fear" (1952).

In 1955, Crawford ended up included with the Pepsi-Cola Company through her marriage to organization Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alfred Steele. In 1970 Crawford resigned from the screen and following an open appearance in 1974 Crawford pulled back from open life, ending up progressively hermitic until her passing in 1977. 

Crawford wedded multiple times. Her initial three relational unions finished in separation; the last finished with the demise of spouse Alfred Steele. She received five youngsters, one of whom was recovered. Crawford's associations with her two senior kids, Christina and Christopher, were sharp. After Crawford's passing, Christina composed an outstanding "tell-all" diary, "Mommie Dearest" (1978). 

Conceived Lucille Fay LeSueur, of English, French Huguenot, Swedish, and Irish family line, in San Antonio, Texas, she was the third and most youthful offspring of Tennessee-conceived Thomas E. LeSueur (January 2, 1868 Ã¢ÂÂ January 1, 1938, who passed on the day preceding his 70th birthday celebration), a clothing worker, and Texas-conceived Anna Bell Johnson (later Mrs. Anna Cassin), whose date of birth is given as November 29, 1884, albeit, in light of evaluation records, she may have been more seasoned. She clearly was still under 20 when her initial two kids were conceived. She kicked the bucket on August 15, 1958. Crawford's senior kin were sister Daisy LeSueur, who passed on before Lucille's introduction to the world, and sibling Hal LeSueur. 

Thomas LeSueur surrendered the family a couple of months before her introduction to the world, in the end resettling in Abilene, Texas, purportedly filling in as a development worker. Following LeSueur's takeoff from the family home, Crawford's mom remarried Henry J. Cassin. Nonetheless, the marriage is recorded in the registration as Crawford's mom's first marriage. Crawford lived with her mom, stepfather, and kin in Lawton, Oklahoma. There, Cassin ran the Ramsey Opera House; he figured out how to book assorted and noted entertainers, for example, Anna Pavlova and Eva Tanguay. Crawford favored the moniker "Billie" as a tyke, and appreciated watching vaudeville acts perform on the phase of her stepfather's theater. Around then, Crawford was apparently ignorant that Cassin, whom she called "daddy", was not her organic dad until her sibling Hal revealed to her reality. Cassin purportedly started explicitly manhandling her when she was eleven years of age, and the maltreatment proceeded until she was sent to St. Agnes Academy, a Catholic young ladies' school. Her family's precariousness contrarily influenced Crawford and her tutoring never formally advanced past essential training. 

Starting in youth, Crawford's aspiration was to be an artist. One day trying to escape piano exercises so she could play with companions, she jumped from the entryway patio of her home and cut her foot seriously on a broken milk bottle. Thus, she experienced three medical procedures to fix the harm. She was unfit to go to primary school, or proceed with moving exercises, for year and a half. 

While as yet dwelling in Lawton, Crawford's stepfather was blamed for theft. In spite of the fact that he was absolved in court, he was boycotted in Lawton, and the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, around 1916. Following their movement, Cassin, a Catholic, set Crawford at St. Agnes Academy in Kansas City. At the point when her mom and stepfather isolated, she stayed at St. Agnes as a work understudy, where she invested unmistakably more energy working, fundamentally cooking and cleaning, than contemplating. She later gone to Rockingham Academy, likewise as a working understudy. While going to there, she started dating, and had her first genuine association with a trumpet player named Ray Sterling. Sterling apparently enlivened her to start testing herself scholastically. 

In 1922, she enrolled at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, giving her time of birth as 1906. She went to Stephens for just a couple of months before pulling back after she understood she was not set up for school. 

Under the name Lucille LeSueur, Crawford started moving in the ensembles of voyaging revues, and was seen moving in Detroit by maker Jacob J. Shubert. Shubert place her in the ensemble line for his 1924 show, "Honest Eyes", at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway in New York City. While showing up in "Guiltless Eyes", Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were purportedly hitched in 1924, and lived respectively for a while, despite the fact that this alleged marriage was never referenced in later life by Crawford. 

Crawford needed extra work, and drew closer Loews Theaters marketing specialist Nils Granlund. Granlund protected a situation for her with artist Harry Richman's demonstration and organized her to complete a screen test which he sent to maker Harry Rapf in Hollywood. Rapf advised Granlund on December 24, 1924, that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) had offered Crawford an agreement at $75 per week. Granlund promptly wired LeSueur, who had come back to her mom's home in Kansas City, with the news; she obtained $400 for movement costs. 

Credited as Lucille LeSueur, her first film was "Woman of the Night" in 1925, as the body twofold for MGM's most well known female star, Norma Shearer. She additionally showed up in "The Circle" and "Pretty Ladies" (both 1925), featuring humorist ZaSu Pitts. This was before long pursued by similarly little and unbilled jobs in two other 1925 quiet movies : "The Only Thing" and "The Merry Widow". 

MGM exposure head Pete Smith perceived her capacity to turn into a noteworthy star, yet felt her name sounded counterfeit; he told studio head Louis B. Mayer that her last name, LeSueur, helped him to remember a sewer. Smith composed a challenge called "Name the Star" in "Motion picture Weekly" to enable perusers to choose her new stage name. The underlying decision was "Joan Arden", yet after another performing artist was found to have earlier case to that name, the other surname "Crawford" turned into the decision. She later said that she needed her first name to be articulated "Jo-Anne", and that she detested the name Crawford since it seemed like "gizzard fish", yet in addition conceded she "loved the security" that ran with the name. 

Becoming progressively disappointed over the size and nature of the parts she was given, Crawford set out on a battle of self-advancement. As MGM screenwriter Frederica Sagor Maas reviewed, "Nobody chose to make Joan Crawford a star. Joan Crawford turned into a star in light of the fact that Joan Crawford chose to turn into a star." She started going to moves in the evenings and nights at lodgings around Hollywood and at move scenes on the shoreline docks, where she frequently won move rivalries with her exhibitions of the Charleston and the Black Bottom. 

Her procedure worked and MGM cast her in the film where she originally established a connection on groups of onlookers, Edmund Goulding's "Sally, Irene and Mary" (1925). From the earliest starting point of her vocation, Crawford thought about Norma Shearer - the studio's most-mainstream performing artist - her expert enemy. Shearer was hitched to MGM Head of Production Irving Thalberg; subsequently, she had the primary selection of contents, and had more control than different stars in what films she would and would not make. Crawford was cited to have stated: "How might I contend with Norma? She lays down with the supervisor!" 

In 1926, Crawford was named one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars, alongside Mary Astor, Dolores del RÄÂ­o, Janet Gaynor, and Fay Wray, among others. That equivalent year, she featured in "Paris", co-featuring Charles Ray. Inside a couple of years, she turned into the sentimental female lead to a significant number of MGM's top male stars, including RamÄÅn Novarro, John Gilbert, William Haines, and Tim McCoy. 

Crawford showed up in "The Unknown" (1927), featuring Lon Chaney, Sr., who played a festival blade hurler without any arms. Crawford played his skimpily-clad youthful fair collaborator whom he plans to wed. She expressed that she took in more about acting from watching Chaney work than from any other person in her vocation. "It was at that point", she stated, "I wound up mindful out of the blue of the distinction between remaining before a camera, and acting." Also in 1927, she showed up nearby her dear companion, William Haines, in "Spring Fever", which was the first of three motion pictures the couple made together. 

In 1928, Crawford featured inverse RamÄÅn Novarro in "Crosswise over to Singapore", yet it was her job as Diana Medford in "Our Dancing Daughters" (1928) that shot her to fame. The job set up her as an image of present day 1920s-style womanliness which equaled Clara Bow, the first It young lady, at that point Hollywood's chief flapper. A surge of hits pursued "Our Dancing Daughters", including two more flapper-themed motion pictures, in which Crawford encapsulated for her army of fans (huge numbers of whom were ladies) a glorified vision of the free-vivacious, all-American young lady. 

F. Scott Fitzgerald composed of Crawford: 

Crawford portrayed her charming onscreen persona all the more compactly, saying "In the event that you need to see the young lady adjacent, go nearby." 

On June 3, 1929, Crawford wedded Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., at Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church (known as "The Actors' Chapel", attributable to its nearness to Broadway theaters) in Manhattan, albeit nor was Catholic. Fairbanks was the child of Douglas Fairbanks and the stepson of Mary Pickford, who were viewed as Hollywood eminence. Fairbanks, Sr., and Pickford were against the marriage, and did not welcome the couple to their home, Pickfair, for eight months after the marriage. 

The connection among Crawford and Fairbanks, Sr., in the long run warmed; she called him "Uncle Doug", and he called her "Billie", her old youth moniker. She and Pickford, nonetheless, kept on detesting one another. Following that first welcome, Crawford and Fairbanks, Jr., turned out to be progressively visit visitors. While the Fairbanks men played golf together, be that as it may, Crawford was either left with Pickford, who might resign to her quarters, or just taken off alone. 

To free herself of her Southwestern inflection, Crawford eagerly rehearsed lingual authority and rhetoric. She stated: 

After the arrival of "The Jazz Singer" in 1927Ã¢ÂÂthe first full length film with some capable of being heard dialogÃ¢ÂÂsound movies, or talkies, as they moved toward becoming nicknamed, were extremely popular. The change from quiet to sound froze many, if not all, required with the film business; numerous quiet film stars got themselves unemployable due to their bothersome voices and difficult to-get complements, or essentially in view of their refusal to make the progress to talkies. 

Numerous studios and stars abstained from making the change to the extent that this would be possible, particularly MGM, which was the remainder of the significant studios to change over to sound. "The Hollywood Revue of 1929" was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first endeavor to exhibit their stars' capacity to make the change from quiet to sound. Crawford was among the at least dozen MGM stars incorporated into the motion picture; she sang the melody "Got a Feeling for You" amid the film's first demonstration. 

Crawford made an effective change to talkies. Her initially featuring job in an all-talking full length film was in "Untamed" (1929), co-featuring Robert Montgomery. In spite of the achievement of the film in the cinema world, it got blended audits from faultfinders, who noticed that while Crawford appeared to be apprehensive at making the progress to sound, she had turned out to be a standout amongst the most mainstream performing artists on the planet." Montana Moon" (1930), an uneasy blend of Western clichÄÅ¡s and music, joined her with John Mack Brown and Ricardo Cortez. Despite the fact that the film had issues with blue pencils, it was a noteworthy accomplishment at the season of its discharge. "Our Blushing Brides" (1930), co-featuring Robert Montgomery and Anita Page, was the last portion in the "Our Dancing Daughters" establishment. Her next motion picture, "Paid" (1930), combined her with Robert Armstrong, and was another achievement. Amid the early solid time, MGM started to put Crawford in increasingly advanced jobs, instead of proceeding to advance her flapper-enlivened persona of the quiet period. 

In 1931, MGM cast Crawford in five movies. Three of them joined her inverse the studio's destined to be greatest male star and "Ruler of Hollywood", Clark Gable. "Move, Fools, Dance", discharged in February 1931, was the principal matching of Crawford and Gable. Their second film together, "Giggling Sinners", discharged in May 1931, was coordinated by Harry Beaumont, and furthermore co-featured Neil Hamilton. "Had", their third movie together, discharged in October, was coordinated by Clarence Brown. These movies were colossally prominent with gatherings of people and were commonly generally welcomed by faultfinders, stapling Crawford's situation as one of MGM's top female stars of the decade alongside Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo and Jean Harlow. Her solitary other eminent film of 1931, "This Modern Age", was discharged in August and regardless of ominous audits was a moderate achievement. 

MGM next cast her in the movie "Great Hotel", coordinated by Edmund Goulding. As the studio's first elite player creation, Crawford co-featured inverse Greta Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Beery, among others. Getting third charging, she played the white collar class stenographer to Beery's controlling general chief. Crawford later confessed to being anxious amid the taping of the motion picture since she was working with "exceptionally enormous stars", and that she was frustrated that she had no scenes with the "divine Garbo". "Terrific Hotel" was discharged in April 1932 to basic and business achievement. It was one of the most noteworthy netting films of the year, and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. 

Crawford made proceeded with progress in "Letty Lynton" (1932). Not long after this current motion picture's discharge, a literary theft suit constrained MGM's withdrawal and it's consequently considered the "lost" Crawford film. Planned by Adrian, the outfit with huge unsettled sleeves which Crawford wore in the film turned into a well known style that equivalent year, and was even replicated by Macy's. 

On credit to United Artists, she played whore Sadie Thompson in "Downpour" (1932), a film form of John Colton's 1923 play. On-screen character Jeanne Eagels assumed the job in front of an audience, and Gloria Swanson had begun the part on screen in the 1928 film adaptation. Crawford's execution was panned, and the film was not a triumph. In spite of the disappointment of "Downpour", in 1932, the distributing of the primary "Top Ten Money-Making Stars Poll" put Crawford third in ubiquity in the cinema world, behind just Marie Dressler and Janet Gaynor. She stayed on the rundown for the following quite a while, keep going showing up on it in 1936. In May 1933, Crawford separated from Fairbanks. Crawford refered to "intolerable mental remorselessness", guaranteeing Fairbanks had "a desirous and suspicious frame of mind" toward her companions, and that they had "noisy contentions about the most trifling subjects" enduring "far into the night". 

Following her separation, she was again collaborated with Clark Gable, alongside Franchot Tone and Fred Astaire, in the hit "Moving Lady" (1933), in which she got top charging. She next assumed the title job in "Sadie McKee" (1934), inverse Tone and Gene Raymond. She was combined with Gable for the fifth time in "Binded" (1934), and for the 6th time in "Neglecting All Others" (1934). Crawford's movies of this period were the absolute most-prevalent and most astounding netting movies of the mid-1930s. 

In 1935, Crawford wedded Franchot Tone, a phase performer from New York who intended to utilize his film income to back his venue gathering. The couple manufactured a little performance center at Crawford's Brentwood home, and put on creations of great plays for select gatherings of companions. Their Brentwood neighborhood was home to numerous Hollywood famous people, including Clark Gable, Charley Chase, and Shirley Temple. Tone and Crawford had first seemed together in "Today We Live" (1933), yet Crawford was reluctant about going into another sentiment so not long after her split from Fairbanks. 

Previously and amid their marriage, Crawford attempted to advance Tone's Hollywood vocation, yet Tone was at last not keen on being a motion picture star he simply needed to be an on-screen character, and Crawford inevitably wearied of the exertion. Amid their marriage they attempted on two separate events for youngsters, both closure in unsuccessful labor. At that point Tone supposedly started drinking and turned out to be physically harsh, she petitioned for legal separation, which was allowed in 1939. Crawford and Tone a lot later revived their fellowship, and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When he kicked the bucket in 1968, Crawford organized him to be incinerated and his cinders dispersed at Muskoka Lakes, Canada. 

Crawford proceeded with her rule as a prominent film performing artist well into the mid-1930s. "No More Ladies" (1935) co-featured Robert Montgomery and after that spouse Franchot Tone, and was a triumph. Crawford had since quite a while ago begged MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in progressively emotional jobs, and in spite of the fact that he was hesitant, he cast her in the complex satire dramatization "I Live My Life" (1935), coordinated by W.S. Van Dyke, and it was generally welcomed by faultfinders. 

She next featured in "The Gorgeous Hussy" (1936), inverse Robert Taylor and Lionel Barrymore, just as Tone. It was a basic and film industry achievement, and wound up one of Crawford's greatest hits of the decade. "Love on the Run" (1936), a lighthearted comedy coordinated by W.S. Van Dyke, was her seventh film co-featuring Clark Gable. It was, at the season of its discharge, called "a great deal of cheerful gibberish" by faultfinders, yet a budgetary achievement regardless. 

Despite the fact that Crawford remained a regarded MGM performing artist, and her movies still earned benefits, her prevalence declined in the late 1930s. In 1937, Crawford was broadcasted the primary "Ruler of the Movies" by "Life" magazine. She surprisingly slipped from seventh to sixteenth spot in the cinema world that year, and her open notoriety additionally started to wind down. Richard Boleslawski's parody dramatization "The Last of Mrs. Cheyney" (1937) joined her inverse William Powell in their sole screen matching. The film was additionally Crawford's last film industry accomplishment before the beginning of her "Film industry Poison" period. 

She co-featured inverse Franchot Tone for the seventhÃ¢ÂÂand finalÃ¢ÂÂtime in "The Bride Wore Red" (1937). The film was commonly negatively investigated by most of pundits. It additionally ran a budgetary misfortune, getting to be one of MGM's greatest disappointments of the year. "Mannequin" costarring Spencer Tracy, additionally discharged in 1937 did, as the "New York Times" expressed, "reestablish Crawford to her royal position as ruler of the working young ladies". 

On May 3, 1938, CrawfordÃ¢ÂÂalong with Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Luise Rainer, John Barrymore, Katharine Hepburn, Fred Astaire, Dolores del RÄÂ­o, and othersÃ¢ÂÂwas named "Film industry Poison" in an open letter in the "Free Film Journal".

All through the whole creation of the film, Curtiz scrutinized Crawford. He allegedly revealed to Jack L. Warner, "She comes here with her high-cap show and her goddamn shoulder braces... For what reason should I squander my time coordinating a has-been?" Purportedly Curtiz tore the shoulder braces from Crawford's body before the team just to locate her wide shoulders. Curtiz requested Crawford demonstrate her reasonableness by taking a screen test; she concurred. After the test, Curtiz consented to Crawford's throwing.
