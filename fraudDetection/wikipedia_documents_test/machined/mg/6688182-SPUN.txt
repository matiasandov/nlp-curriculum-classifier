In 1998, Air Team began flights to Oslo and Stavanger, which were supplanted by Bergen Air Transport administrations to Bergen from 2000. 

The main designs for an air terminal serving Notodden were propelled in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, executive of the visitor office. In late 1954 or mid 1955, he held a gathering with Ludvig G. Braathen, proprietor of Braathens SAFE, and agents for his aircraft. They considered Notodden to be a conceivable entryway to Telemark and Braathen guaranteed to begin traveling to an air terminal serving Notodden, should one be manufactured. At the time, Braathen had begun traveling to a few littler air terminals in Norway utilizing an armada of de Havilland Heron air ship. Braathen had been going around Norway and urging regions to manufacture territorial airplane terminals, expressing that he needed more yet littler air terminals than the focal experts were arranging. He prevailing at having comparative air terminals worked in Hamar and RÄÂ¸ros. 

The issue was first talked about politically on 23 April 1955. The districts of Heddal and Notodden achieved an understanding concerning financing and possession the airplane terminal, whereby Notodden would claim seven elevenths and Heddal four elevenths of the air terminal. Development of the air terminal cost 200,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), which incorporated a runway.
