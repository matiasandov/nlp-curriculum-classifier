The collection was blended by Kasper at Studio X. 

Out of the blue since 1993's "Versus.", the band individuals did not go into the chronicle sessions with any finished tunes, just guitar riffs. Vedder conceded that the band "truly ran in with nothing." The band sat around playing music together and talked about the melody courses of action, and in only multi week had finished ten tunes. Ament depicted it as a "genuine synergistic exertion," and Vedder portrayed it as "outright majority rule government." Guitarist Mike McCready expressed that the band individuals were feeling "crisp and lively" and "were conveying like nothing anyone's ever seen." Toward the finish of the sessions it came down to Vedder to wrap up the material, with Ament seeing that "the manner in which the record began and the manner in which that it completed is presumably two unique things." Regarding his verse composing process, Vedder said that he composed no less than four distinct arrangements of verses for every melody, with many going as high as eight.

Director Kelly Curtis marked a one-record manage J Records - which unexpectedly amid creation moved toward becoming, similar to Epic, a backup of Sony Music after said organization converged with J's parent organization BMG. J had moved toward Pearl Jam as ahead of schedule as 2001, and had its first explores different avenues regarding the band issuing the live collection "Live at Benaroya Hall" in 2004. Vedder said J was picked as they looked for "someone who'll enable us to be our identity and regards how we get things done" and contributed with the "assistance of getting the music out there". Gossard included the name did not enter whenever or innovative imperatives upon the band - " We didn't play them much music until it was essentially done, and they were satisfied. They weren't anticipating that us should accomplish something that was unnatural for us." 

Various faultfinders refered to the collection as an arrival to the band's foundations. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated, "Almost 15 years after "Ten", Pearl Jam at last came back to the qualities of their presentation with 2006's "Pearl Jam", a pointedly engaged arrangement of enthusiastic hard shake." Vedder stated, "It's effectively the best stuff we've done yet in addition probably the hardest stuff. It's forceful, on the grounds that once more, it's sort of a result of what it resembles to be an American nowadays. It's quite forceful, particularly when you turn it uproarious." Gossard included that after numerous exploratory collections, "Pearl Jam" was "like a meeting up again regarding tolerating our normal qualities and furthermore fusing the best of our analyses". 

The collection starts with various up-rhythm melodies before growing to an assortment of beats for its second half. Vedder credited the quicker and progressively forceful melodies to the band composing a great deal of material that continued getting pared down, with the band deserting mid-rhythm tunes, while Ament recommended that it was a result of the band adjusting recording and visiting which brought about "physicalityÃ¢Â ... from being out and about." The band endeavored to make a situation in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play much as they do live. Ament said that there was "a great deal of sharpening of the guitars and vocals in the center and close to the end," which brought about the collection sounding "progressively cleaned." On the general sentiment of the collection, Ament stated, "The band playing in a roomÃ¢ÂÂthat went over. There's a sort of instantaneousness to the record, and that is the thing that we were going for." 

Current socio-political issues in the United States are tended to on the collection, with Vedder guaranteeing the record "manages genuine substance and the ethical issues within recent memory", and crediting as motivation both the disappointment with George W. Shrubbery being reelected, and the introduction of Vedder's girl - "Since I consider it to be my little girl's planet, I'm considerably progressively (furious)." McCready stated, "We as a whole vibe that we're living in turbulent, startling occasions, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to whatever resembles despotism. Furthermore, simply awful political choices being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're disappointed. So a great deal of those emotions have turned out in these tunes." Vedder likewise included that among all the dull topics "the expectation would have been in the guitar performances. It was the guitars and drums grinding away that was going to lift you out of the dim pit that I had painted."

Huge numbers of the tunes are composed from the perspective of a hero, which rose up out of an early thought of transforming the record into an idea collection - as guitarist Stone Gossard clarified, "we considered utilizing portrayal to specifically bind together the collection, in any case a less applied structure just felt right." Vedder included that utilizing characters in the tracks assisted with the topics, as the narratives could "transmit a feeling or an inclination or a perception of current reality as opposed to editorializing, which we've seen a lot of nowadays". 

Vedder included that numerous tunes were motivated by the passing of individual performer Johnny Ramone, whom he depicted as "the closest companion I at any point had on the planet". The verses of "Life Wasted" specifically were composed in the wake of going to Ramone's burial service.

Damien Echols, one of the three individuals from the West Memphis 3, co-composed the verses to "Armed force Reserve". Out of the blue McCready contributed verses to a Pearl Jam collection, composing the verses to the end track "Inside Job". McCready said that he composed the verses while visiting in SÄÅo Paulo as he "want[ed] this tune to occur" regardless of Vedder not having done the verses yet, and included that the melodious motivation was the acknowledgment that "I needed to go inside myself first before I could be available to outside thoughts." 

The collection's spread craftsmanship, captured by Brad Klausen, portrays an avocado cut down the middle with the seed still set up. McCready stated, "That symbolizes simply kind ofÃ¢Â ... Ed's toward the finish of the procedure and stated, though I couldn't care less at the present time, we've made such a decent showing with regards to on this record, and we're somewhat drained from it. We should toss an avocado on the spread. I believe that is the thing that occurred, and our specialty executive goes, hello, that is not a terrible thought. I think we were viewing the Super Bowl, and we had some guacamole or something." Because the collection is self-titled, numerous fans allude to it as "Avocado" or "The Avocado Album."

On the decision of a self-titled collection, Vedder clarified, "At last, we thought there was sufficient there with the title of the tunes, so to put another title on the collection would have appeared to be vainglorious. In this way, extremely, it's really "Nothing" by Pearl Jam."
