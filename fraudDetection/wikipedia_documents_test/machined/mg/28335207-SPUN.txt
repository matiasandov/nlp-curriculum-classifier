Established in 1927 in Jerusalem by Salomon Angel, Angel Bakeries acquainted with the Israeli market the principal cut bread, plant-based emulsifiers, and new heating innovations. It has dependably been family-run, at first by Salomon with his siblings and children, at that point by Salomon's grandsons, and today by Salomon's extraordinary grandsons. The organization, Salomon A. Heavenly attendant Ltd., is traded on an open market on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, with a turnover of $180 million out of 2008. 

The first Angel's Bakery was set up in Bayit VeGan by Salomon (Shlomo) Angel, a seventh-age Jerusalemite and scion of a Sephardi family that followed its heredity back to Jews who were removed from Spain in 1492. Conceived in the Mishkenot Sha'ananim neighborhood of Jerusalem, Angel was initially an educator in an Alliance school in Jerusalem, where he began to look all starry eyed at the principalÃ¢ÂÂs little girl. Be that as it may, foremost Chaim Farhi would just enable him to wed his girl, Esther, on the off chance that he left educating and "earned a job". Salomon concurred and turned into a dry-merchandise shipper. The couple wedded in 1916 and had three children and three little girls. 

Holy messenger turned into a fruitful dry-merchandise vendor, heading out routinely to Alexandria, Damascus, and Beirut to purchase flour and other fundamental foodstuffs to sell in Jerusalem. In 1927 one of Angel's clients, the Trachtenberg Bakery in Bayit VeGan, went bankrupt. Holy messenger chose to satisfy the pastry shop's obligations and expect possession, getting his dad Avraham and three siblings as accomplices. A couple of years after the fact, two of his siblings, Leon and Refael, left to open their very own bread kitchen in Haifa. 

Heavenly attendant improved the bread-production task by presenting Israel's previously mechanized gauging machines and putting resources into new generation lines. He frequently dozed medium-term at the bread kitchen amid the week and came back to his home in Talpiot when the pastry shop was shut on Shabbat.

Amid World War II, the pastry shop contracted to supply bread to the British armed force, requiring the buy of expansive American-made broilers that could turn out 540 portions for each hour. 

Blessed messenger's Bakery assumed a key job in nourishing Jerusalem occupants amid the 1948 War of Independence. At the point when Arabs lay attack to the city and assaulted caravans that endeavored to bring nourishment and supplies through the restricted mountain go from Tel Aviv, water and flour were hard to find. Fire engines were utilized to carry water to the bread shop and "flour was cleared up off the pastry shop floor". Blessed messenger's child Danny, who was a Haganah contender shielding the assaulted Old City, reviewed that the pastry shop would send bread in escorts to the warriors in the Old City and Mount Scopus, and shroud weapons and ammo in the sacks of bread. One of the principal steeds utilized for the Jewish attack on the Arabs' Old City positions originated from Angel's Bakery; its feet were enveloped by old flour sacks so the British wouldn't identify it. 

During the 1950s Salomon's three children, Avraham, Ovadia and Danny, accepted administrative positions; they progressed toward becoming co-CEOs after Salomon's passing in 1966. In 1958 Angel's Bakery moved to its present area in the Givat Shaul modern zone at the side of Beit Hadfus and Farbstein Streets. The site was picked in light of the fact that it remained over the road from a flour factory. The Angel siblings assembled Israel's first flour storehouse and appointed a Texas organization to build a 750-foot pipeline to pass on flour legitimately from the plant to the storehouse to the pastry shop. Today this pipeline conveys 120 tons of flour to the bread kitchen every day.

Be that as it may, wellbeing nourishment shoppers were careful about the primary entire wheat portions since they were white, not dark colored. Working with the Health Food Association, Angel's concocted the arrangement of adding all-common molasses to the bread to give it a dark colored shading. 

Heavenly attendant's built up the main generation line in Israel with the ability to create 3,300 portions of bread for each hour. Thirteen other bread creation lines in its different plants each yield more than 2,000 portions for each hour. One generation line in Jerusalem has the ability to turn out 10,000 pitas in three hours. On every day of the eight-day Hanukkah celebration, the Jerusalem plant likewise fries up 250,000 sufganiyot, the jam filled donut supported by Israelis at this season. 

The pastry kitchen's carefully controlled stoves persistently modify temperatures to oblige the maturing and preparing forms; these broilers can likewise heat diverse kinds of bread at various temperatures on the top and base of every stove. Notwithstanding the accentuation on development and computerization, Angel's challahs are as yet plaited by hand. 

Heavenly attendant's Bakery opened its milestone industrial facility store contiguous the Givat Shaul plant in 1984. The store offers a full determination of bundled breads, rolls, and biscuits, bourekas, danishes, extravagant cakes, high quality baked goods, espresso and soda pops.

Toward the finish of the Passover occasion, a long queue of clients generally frames outside the store after 12 pm, holding on to purchase the principal bread off the generation line. 

Likewise in 1984, the organization started delivering cakes and cakes in a processing plant in Jerusalem, and starting during the 1990s it started building and gaining different bread shops in a move to differentiate its items and advertising base. It manufactured another bread kitchen in Lod in 1995 and obtained the Tuv Tam pastry shop in Netivot in 1999. Today the organization claims and works five plants:

In those early days, emulsifiers were made with creature based fats which were not fit. Ovadia Angel and his group created emulsifiers from hydrogenated fats, a vegetable-based source, and later sold this new learning to different organizations. 

Another kashrut challenge which the pastry kitchen defeated in the mid 1950s concerned the capacity to deliver crisp bread available to be purchased on Sunday mornings after the plant had been shut for Shabbat as per Jewish law. Ordinarily batter takes four to six hours to rise, yet the pastry shop gained a blender made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could create mixture in just two hours, consequently enabling the bread kitchen to prepare bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning conveyances. Today Angel Bakeries possesses nine such blenders, five of which are utilized in its Jerusalem plant.
