New York State Route 239 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 239 (NYÃÂ 239) was a state roadway in eastern Erie County, New York, United States. The southern end of the course was at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 354 in Marilla. Its northern end was at an intersection with U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 20 (USÃÂ 20) in the town of Alden. NYÃÂ 239 was about long and named Exchange Street. At the point when NYÃÂ 239 was doled out as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state thruways in New York, it stretched out eastbound to the Wyoming County town of Attica. NYÃÂ 239 was truncated to Marilla in 1949 and expelled from the state thruway framework totally in September 1980 because of a roadway upkeep swap between the province of New York and Erie County prior that year. The roadway is currently County RouteÃ¢Â 578 (CRÃÂ 578). 

NYÃÂ 239 started at a convergence with NYÃÂ 354 only west of the ErieÃ¢ÂÂWyoming district line in the town of Marilla. The course at that point headed out toward the upper east, moving in rise as it continued ahead. It at that point made a swing toward the north, slipping in height. Running at about a stature of above ocean level, NYÃÂ 239 crossed into the town of Alden and proceeded toward downtown. NYÃÂ 239 proceeded with northward, passing adjacent Henskee Road, a connector among NYÃÂ 239 and County Line Road, which ran parallel to NYÃÂ 239 along the ErieÃ¢ÂÂGenesee area line. The course plunged further in height, entering the town of Alden. Inside the town, it passed the Buffalo Water Filtration Plant toward the west and crossed the Conrail-claimed Southern Tier Line. NYÃÂ 239 went through an essentially neighborhood of the town just before ending at USÃÂ 20 in the town focus. 

NYÃÂ 239 as a feature of the 1930 renumbering of state interstates in New York to an arrangement stretching out from NYÃÂ 35 in the town of Alden to NYÃÂ 98 in the town of Attica by method for the village of Cowlesville. The eastÃ¢ÂÂwest street connecting NYÃÂ 239 close Cowlesville to Two Rod Road (at that point NYÃÂ 358) north of Marilla was at first unnumbered. It turned out to be a piece of a realigned NYÃÂ 354 . NYÃÂ 354 was expanded eastbound on JanuaryÃ¢Â 1, 1949, over NYÃÂ 239's arrangement to another end in Attica. Accordingly, NYÃÂ 239 was truncated to its intersection with NYÃÂ 354 in the town of Marilla. 

On AprilÃ¢Â 1, 1980, possession and support of NYÃÂ 239 was exchanged from the province of New York to Erie County as a feature of a bigger interstate upkeep swap between the two dimensions of government. The NYÃÂ 239 assignment was evacuated on SeptemberÃ¢Â 25 of that year. The expressway is currently assigned by Erie County as CRÃÂ 578.
