"Vatos" highlights a succession close to the finish of the scene, in which a crowd of walkers attacks and assaults the campgrounds. The scene was composed by Robert Kirkman, who put together it intimately with respect to a comparable succession in the funnies. Kirkman expressed that he was extremely eager to build up the arrangement and included that it was a well-known undertaking for him: 

It was exceptionally energizing. I got the chance to compose the assault toward the finish of the episodeÃ¢ÂÂwhich was especially something that occurred in the comic book seriesÃ¢ÂÂso I realized I would return to something I had officially composed. Be that as it may, as we were in the scholars' room, when things began moving which prompted so much new stuff that wasn't in the comic book arrangement, I believed that was incredible in light of the fact that it wasn't me composing the equivalent old same-old or changing something I had effectively done and attempting to make it intriguing for myself. It was extremely a totally new story: getting the posse individuals in there and getting the chance to compose Daryl [...] which is one of my most loved characters on the show, notwithstanding the way that heÃ¢ÂÂs not in the comic book. It was an impact. 

Close by the fundamental cast, the scene presented Vatos band, created by Neil Brown Jr. as Guillermo, Noel G. as Felipe, Anthony Guajardo as Miguel, Gina Morelli as Abuela, and James Gonzaba as Jorge. The remainder of the group is shaped by Roger Herrera and Timothy Douglas Perez. This scene denoted the last standard appearance of Emma Bell (Amy), whose character was slaughtered off in the finish of the portion. His demise is viewed as one of the twenieth most stunning passings in the arrangement. Greg Nicotero, the show's creation architect, established the walker who chomps Amy. Chime expressed that Nicotero put a skin-hued prosthetic around her neck, which comprised of a layer of red gooey fluid and a hose. When it was nibbled into, the prosthetic detonated and looked like an extreme tissue wound. Kirkman communicated that it was troublesome for him to expel Bell from the cast however was grateful that she comprehended she would just be constrained to a specific number of scenes; he expressed: 

It's something that is extremely troublesome for me. Since it is lines on paper when I do it in the comic book arrangement. It resembles, 'Gracious, alright, Charlie Adlard [...] doesnÃ¢ÂÂt need to draw that course of action of lines any longer, that individual is dead.' But it's entirely awkward for me to be on set, since I see these on-screen characters that are there and, in the source material, I have murdered everything except two of them. I stroll through the set and I'm similar to, 'That's right, murdered that one, slaughtered that one, executed that one.' And it is terminating those individuals. I feel downright awful for Emma Bell, since she was extraordinary and I would have jumped at the chance to have had her in the show. Be that as it may, you know, this is "The Walking Dead", characters must pass on. Fortunately, Emma was carried onto the show with the understanding that she was just going to be in a specific number of scenes and she realized that she was going to pass on from the earliest starting point. Yet, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt truly make it any simpler. When they were shooting those scenes, I needed to travel to Comic-Con thus I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt quite for when she passed on. Be that as it may, it was exceptionally passionate on set and I realize that she was very disturbed about leaving the group and the performers. You sort of become a family when you're completing a TV appear and itÃ¢ÂÂs a bit of annoying to need to dispose of someone.

Since nothing winds up happening to it from a plot point of view [...], it's hard not to consider it one of those funnies where two have a major battle scene that ends up being mixed up character."
