Domentziolus (nephew of Phocas) 

Domentziolus () or Domnitziolus (Greek: ÃÂÃ®Å¼Ã®ÅºÃ®ËÃ®Å¡ÄÂÃ®ÅÃ®Å¼Ã®Å¼Ã®Å¥Ã®Å¼ÄÂ) was a nephew of the Byzantine ruler Phocas (r. 602Ã¢ÂÂ610), selected "curopalates" and general in the East amid his uncle's rule. He was one of the senior Byzantine military pioneers amid the opening phases of the ByzantineÃ¢ÂÂSassanid War of 602Ã¢ÂÂ628. His annihilations opened the route for the fall of Mesopotamia and Armenia and the attack of Anatolia by the Persians. In 610, Phocas was toppled by Heraclius, and Domentziolus was caught however gotten away genuine mischief. 

The definite parentage of Domentziolus is vague: Phocas had two known siblings, Comentiolus and another likewise named Domentziolus, who has now and then been recommended as the more youthful Domentziolus' dad. Soon after the promotion of Phocas, in 603, the more youthful Domentziolus was raised to the titles of "vir gloriosissimus", "patricius" and "curopalates". 

Domentziolus, nonetheless, is also called a general in the Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602Ã¢ÂÂ628. Phocas' height to the position of royalty had been perceived by neither the Sassanid Persian shah Khosrau II, nor by Narses, the Byzantine legislative head of the area of Mesopotamia. The two had associated against Phocas, with Narses gathering his powers in Edessa, while hanging tight for Sassanid fortifications. In 604, Phocas named Domentziolus as "magister militum per Orientem" and sent him against the Persians. His ancestors Germanus and Leontius had both been crushed, the previous executed in fight and the last reviewed and detained by Phocas. 

As indicated by the "Life" of St. Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus fell into a Persian snare yet had the capacity to get away. In 604/605, he likewise encompassed Narses and his troops, and influenced him to surrender on certifications of his own security. Phocas, regardless, had Narses executed by consuming him alive. At about a similar time, Dara, a vital Byzantine city in Mesopotamia, tumbled to the Persians. Khosrau was urged to stop just striking the Byzantine areas, rather endeavoring to overcome them. In 607, he propelled simultaneous intrusions on Mesopotamia and Armenia. 

With the Byzantine powers at the Persian front having just endured substantial setbacks in past encounters, Domentziolus was unfit to restrict the Sassanid assaults amid 605. There was additionally minimal shot of further fortifications. Phocas had finished up harmony settlements with the Lombards and Avars trying to verify control of his regions in the Italian Peninsula and the Balkans. He had effectively stripped the Balkans of the majority of their military powers, reassigning them to the Persian front. Be that as it may, this strategy had reverse discharges with the undermanned Balkans confronting a Slavic attack, prominently imperiling Thessalonica. 

While one Persian power, under Shahrbaraz, had the capacity to verify control of Amida, Domentziolus focused his endeavors on a second one under Shahin Vahmanzadegan. He was vigorously crushed in the region of Theodosiopolis (present day Erzurum), and the Persians had the capacity to recuperate a large portion of Persarmenia, which had been surrendered to Byzantium in 591. In 608, Shahrbaraz and Shahin proceeded with their particular endeavors to overcome Mesopotamia and Armenia. 

By 609, the Sassanid victory of Mesopotamia and Armenia was for the most part total. Shahin next drove an attack of Cappadocia. Domentziolus' powers were circumvent, while another brother of Phocas, called Sergius, endeavored to confront the trespassers and was slaughtered in battle. Sergius was perhaps "magister militum per Armeniam". Shahin figured out how to catch Caesarea Mazaca (current Kayseri), the principle city of the territory. His powers were then ready to make strikes "right to Chalcedon" in Bithynia, in the region of Constantinople. 

In the mean time, another front had opened. The Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder had rebelled against Phocas. The circumstance in 609Ã¢ÂÂ610 was rapidly getting to be desperate for Domentziolus and all Phocas supporters. Their resistance against the Sassanids had fizzled. There were Persian powers in Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria and the Anatolian areas. Dissident Byzantine powers held Africa and Egypt. Slavs were involving northern Illyricum. In Thessalonica and different towns of Anatolia and Syria, the Blues and Greens were settling their disparities with open clash. In zones of Syria, the Jews were revolting and lynching Christians. Indeed, even in Constantinople, the groups provoked Phocas for his adoration for alcohol, suggesting liquor abuse. 

In 610, Shahrbaraz was moving toward Antioch. Be that as it may, the Persian front was not the prompt danger: the radicals of Africa were. Having verified control of Egypt, they continued to attack Syria and Cyprus while a huge armada under Heraclius the Younger, a child of the exarch, set sail for Constantinople. Supporters from Sicily, Crete and Thessalonica were joining his crusade. The radicals achieved Constantinople in October 610. The main powers accessible to Phocas to protect the city were the Excubitors of his protector and the sporadic powers of the Blues and Greens, the city's hustling groups. Priscus, the administrator of the Excubitors, picked the minute to uncover his faithfulness to Heraclius, having obviously covertly schemed for quite a while. The Greens additionally changed sides. Constantinople fell without hardly lifting a finger. 

Heraclius the Younger turned into the new Byzantine head. Phocas was executed, alongside a few of his family and followers. Domentziolus too was condemned to death, however was acquitted and discharged after the intervention of Theodore of Syceon. Nothing further is known about him after that. 

As indicated by the hagiography of Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus was hitched to a woman named Irene, and had three children. Elizabeth Dawes outlines the story given as following: "Domnitziolus, patrician and curopalates, asks Theodore to visit him in Arcadianae. His better half Eirene has no kids: the holy person favors her and guarantees her three youngsters - and they will be young men. All the male and female captives of the family unit are conveyed to Theodore for his approval. A slave young lady had for quite some time been poorly, disturbed by a shrouded evil presence. He beats on her bosom and the evil spirit pronounces itself. At that point the Saint laying her on the ground Put his foot on her neck, turned his eyes toward the east and expressed a quiet petition. Toward the finish of his petition he recounted so anyone might hear the hymn of the Holy Trinity. For quite a while the slave young lady stayed confused and after that was totally restored. Later Eirene brought forth three children, as the Saint had forecasted. The origination of her first child promptly pursued the Saint's supplication. Sovereign and Patriarch express goodbye to Theodore and he comes back to his cloister." Since Theodore passed on by 613, the story would need to happen before this date.
