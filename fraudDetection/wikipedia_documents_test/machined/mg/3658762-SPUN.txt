That night they made it 15 miles downstream in obscurity and stowed away in the mud on the stream's edge at dawn. The two were recovered 12Ã¢Ë hours after they had gotten away when they were spotted by anglers along the shore early that morning and were given over to officers.

Coker and his better half are likewise dynamic in chapel and community exercises, for example, mentoring youthful wedded couples. Coker still has bad dreams from his time as a POW. Thinking about his wartime encounters in a Veterans Day tribute to POWs, he said "In case you're never tried, you don't know...You're equipped for significantly more than you understand, on the off chance that you truly set your psyche to it. Take a gander at me. I did it, and there's nothing unique about me. I'm simply one more person." Coker proceeded to state some portion of that is "...realizing there's an option that is greater than yourself..."
