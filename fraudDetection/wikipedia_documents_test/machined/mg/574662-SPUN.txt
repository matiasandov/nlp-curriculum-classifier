The essential inspiration of the player is to get away from the island and, all the while, manage the powers attempting to take the Shaper privileged insights relinquished on Sucia Isle. 

The amusement's setting originated from the possibility of players having the capacity to make and control a gathering of respectful animals. The Shapers and the universe of "Geneforge" were the aftereffect of Vogel envisioning how might a being have such power and how might they use it. The amusement's setting, a blend of sci-fi and dream, varies from the unadulterated sci-fi setting the diversion had been imagined as. Vogel experienced issues offsetting interactivity with the ground-breaking coordinated vitality weapons players would hope to use in a sci-fi diversion. Deals surpassed the engineer's desires, regardless of fears that the takeoff from Spiderweb's "Avernum" arrangement would hinder players. "Geneforge" got a positive gathering from commentators, in spite of the nature of the designs being appraised as poor and the amusement containing one bit of music, the title subject.

As the player's gathering performs undertakings or annihilations foes they get understanding, prompting expanded dimensions and extra aptitude focuses. The player character's ability focuses can be utilized to build their measurements or to improve their fitness in one of the fifteen accessible aptitudes. Canisters which increment aptitudes or include new capacities are dispersed all through the amusement. 

Prior to beginning the amusement, players browse three essential character classes, every one of which has a specific playing style. Gatekeepers are contenders who exceed expectations in standard battle abilities, particularly hand-to-hand battling. They are equipped for forming manifestations, yet have little proclivity for enchantment. Specialists exceed expectations in spell throwing and are fit for hand-to-hand battle, however have poor forming abilities.

Each of the three character classes can utilize diverse techniques, contingent upon which abilities they are adroit in. A few zones are hard to pass, and a few assignments are hard to finish, except if the player character is a sure class. Each character class has an alternate battle style, the battle aptitudes they are related with cost less expertise focuses to increment. 

Pith is utilized for both making animals and throwing spells; the number, type and quality of manifestations is restricted by the player's embodiment limit. For example, if a character with 70 most extreme embodiment gathers an animal which costs 20 substance, their greatest pith is diminished to 50 until the creation is demolished, either through battle or being consumed by the Shaper to recapture quintessence. A sum of 18 distinct manifestations are included in the amusement, with bigger and all the more dominant animals costing more substance to make. The sorts and qualities of manifestations can be adjusted relying upon the player's battle style. Manifestations going with the player get a level of the experience focuses got for finishing missions or vanquishing enemies, step up and accepting ability focuses in a similar way as the player character. These expertise focuses can be spent to expand manifestations' measurements, however every measurement increment costs more pith and lessens the measure of substance accessible to call different manifestations or cast spells. Embodiment and wellbeing are recaptured from Shaper-planned pools or by entering a cordial town. 

Battle is turn-based, with each character in the player's gathering accepting activity focuses toward the start of the player's turn. The number got is subject to the things the player character has prepared and the abilities the character or manifestations have. Each activity utilizes a particular number of focuses, for instance, moving one square takes a solitary point and assaults or spells take five. Assaulting or spellcasting with less than ten activity focuses quickly closes the character's turn, generally a character can keep on acting until they come up short on focuses. Most adversaries will assault the player immediately, withdrawing in dread in the event that they achieve a specific edge of harm without being executed. Other specific practices are additionally present, including animals which call for help, or animals which go about as guards and retreat to a snare area when undermined. Manifestations made by the player character can likewise be constrained by a comparable computerized reasoning, or the player can put more substance in the creation's insight and control them physically. 

"Geneforge"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s discourse is conveyed through on-screen content. Experiences with wise manifestations or people result in the player being given a progression of pre-decided inquiries or reactions. Discussion alternatives and the result of those discussions change as per the player's past connections. just as which missions have been finished; which things the player has; which bunch the player has a place with and the player's initiative expertise. The player can gather things from crushed adversaries and the diversion conditions to improve their very own hardware.

The businessperson has a fixed measure of gold toward the beginning of the diversion which does not renew itself. It is feasible for the player to deplete all retailers of their gold stores, making it difficult to sell further things. 

The player starts as a start of an amazing faction of conjurers, the Shapers. Individuals from the order make living creatures from the enchanted substance inside themselves. Disciples are sent to institutes to gain proficiency with the craft of forming and the player's character has been acknowledged to do as such. The player leaves on a voyage to the institute on board an uncommonly altered Drayk, a monster like Shaper Creation. Amid the voyage, the Shaper passes a gathering of islands, one of which is perceived as the Barred Sucia Island. Areas Barred by the Shapers are shut to both the organization and outcasts alike, which means a calamity has happened or something truly important is situated there. As the Shaper analyzes Sucia, out to lunch, the specialty is assaulted and mortally injured by a unidentified cruising ship. In the wake of lighting the vessel's sails with a fireball, the art stores the Shaper on a deserted dockside before biting the dust. The player is presently stranded on Sucia Island and must figure out how to leave. 

Investigation of the docks uncovers a bizarre canister loaded up with twirling fluid. Thinking the canister contains recuperating or empowering properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and ingests the substance. Rather the substance retain into the Shaper's body, reinforcing and evolving it. The progressions become unmistakably obvious, the player character's skin smoothens and shines somewhat. The canisters likewise influence the client's psychological state, causing a progressively fierce and pompous personality. Serviles stay on the island, having been deserted when the island was Barred. They are shrewd manifestations of Shapers, intended to serve them beyond a shadow of a doubt or wavering. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have isolated into three gatherings with contrasting methods of insight in regards to their makers. The Obeyers are as yet devoted to the Shapers, the Awakened trust that they ought to be treated as equivalents. The Takers have rejected Shapers totally and see the organization as oppressors to be battled. 

Subsequent to experiencing the three servile gatherings, the player starts to learn of a gathering of outsiders known as Sholai, travelers who have been wrecked on the island. It was the Sholai, driven by a man named Trajkov, who assaulted the player with their final ship. Trajkov controls a gadget called the Geneforge, made by the Shapers, which can revise the client's DNA and make them staggeringly amazing. This is the reason for the island's Barred status, the gadget was esteemed excessively unsafe in the wrong hands. Trajkov and his supporters have aligned themselves with the Takers, retaining the substance of canisters and attempting to guarantee Shaper controls as their own. The gathering have been unfit to enact the Geneforge itself because of a Shaper being expected to initiate the gadget. A Shaper named Goettsch was hijacked for this reason, in a similar way as the player-character. Goettsch fled and stole the forming gloves expected to securely utilize the Geneforge, causing Trajkov to endeavor to capture the player as a substitution. Amid these occasions, some Sholai have gotten away from their undeniably rough and eccentric pioneer. 

The player is allowed to join any of the servile gatherings and offer shared objectives, or remain unaligned. "Geneforge" can be finished without joining any gathering. Trajkov can be executed through battle or deceived into murdering himself by utilizing the Geneforge. He can likewise be helped in initiating the gadget, if the player takes the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player counterfeit shaper gauntlets, which don't shield Trajkov from the Geneforge's vitality should he be persuaded they are certifiable molding gloves. The player can total the amusement by utilizing the keep going vessel on Sucia Island. The little vessel is secured in a monitored dock on the furthest side of the island. Completing the amusement opens one of in excess of twelve diversion endings, reliant on the player's activities amid the amusement. 

Work on "Geneforge" started amid the improvement of "Avernum 2", at first little data was uncovered. In a meeting distributed by "RPGDot" Vogel contrasted the amusement's development framework with "Aftermath" and uncovered that another diversion motor was being actualized. The task had at first been proposed as unadulterated sci-fi however this was before long deserted for a blended dream and sci-fi setting. In a meeting distributed on site "RPG Codex", Vogel expressed this was expected challenges keeping up diversion offset with cutting edge weaponry which "ought to destroy". He included "I observed it to be too hard to even think about modeling the weapons in a manner that all the while felt reasonable and looked after parity." 

"Geneforge" originated from making a crowd of animals and the capacity to think about those animals or send them to their demises. The decision was to be made by the player. Starting here, Vogel thought about who might almost certainly increase such powers, how they would control them and how these animals would be dealt with. The amusement was created with the expectation of giving players decisions; which groups to favor, how non-Shaper human pariahs are dealt with and whether to seek after objectives through battle or discretion. Dissimilar to most pretending diversions, "Geneforge" was structured so it is conceivable to finish the amusement without utilizing savagery. Vogel refered to "", "Deus Ex" and "EverQuest" as impacts. 

The diversion denoted a takeoff from the "Avernum" arrangement and its ancestor the "Outcast" arrangement, Vogel communicated a need to deal with different tasks - "like clockwork, I have to accomplish something cool and strange. It keeps me intrigued." He expressed that the distinctions in "Geneforge" implied the diversion may battle to discover a crowd of people, anyway deals surpassed his desires. 

"Geneforge" got positive surveys, the amusement's story and absence of bugs got acclaim specifically. InsideMacGames<nowiki>'</nowiki> Christopher Morin recommended that players inspired by a "solid storyline and a one of a kind interpretation of enchantment" would be awed, however not the individuals who looked for superb illustrations and sound. The diversion's setting has been depicted as exceptional and new, the dimension of detail in "Geneforge"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s anecdotal world was lauded by commentators. Jeff Green of "PC Gaming World" applauded the amusement for its "story and ongoing interaction" as something that high-spending diversions regularly need. 

The nature of the amusement's illustrations was appraised inadequately by most analysts, commentators noticed that the general nature of the diversion compensated for this insufficiency. GameSpy's Carla Harker depicted the illustrations as "...dated by around seven years" and the amusement as a "mechanical outcast", in spite of calling it a standout amongst the best pretending recreations discharged in the previous year. Green likewise depicted illustrations as dated and something to endure for ongoing interaction. Site Just RPG's Eric Arevalo depicted them as shortsighted yet noticed the diversion's story and the capacity to control "intriguing freak animals" compensated for this. The Entertainment Depot's Nick Stewart varied, adulating the illustrations as "Oversimplified without being plain, sumptuous without being overcompensated" just as the smoothness of character liveliness and detail of character structures. 

The practically all out absence of music, aside from the title screen signature melody, and complete absence of voice acting was noted by commentators. This featured the diversion's audio effects and natural sounds, for example, weapons conflicting and the foundation commotion of towns. Scratch Stewart found "a genuinely tolerable assortment of impacts and clamors dispersed all through", that they "added to some degree to the experience", however wound up disturbed by the measure of murmuring and flying in the natural sounds after broadened play. Carla Harker portrayed the sound as "Nearly non-existent" and Eric Arevalo found that there weren't sufficient audio effects. RPGDot's Val Sucher noticed that the music player Winamp could be played out of sight, because of the amusement's little memory necessities.
