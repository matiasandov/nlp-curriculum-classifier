Interstate 780 

Interstate 780 (I-780) is an Interstate Highway in the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. territory of California. It serves to interface Interstate 80 in Vallejo with Interstate 680 only north of the Benicia-Martinez Bridge in Benicia. It intently parallels the Carquinez Strait for its whole course. Initially, this portion was a piece of I-680 preceding that Interstate was stretched out and rerouted to Fairfield. The city-kept up Curtola Parkway proceeds with west from I-80 to State Route 29 in Vallejo. 

The Interstate 780 state-kept up turnpike starts at Lemon Street and Curtola Parkway, rapidly crossing underneath I-80 at a cloverleaf exchange. The road goes through pieces of unincorporated Solano County, at that point travels southeast along the Benicia State Recreation Area (a bog). It at that point sidesteps downtown Benicia through the slopes toward the north. I-780 finishes at I-680 at the north end of the Benicia-Martinez Bridge, with I-680 traveling south through the East Bay to San Jose. 

I-780 is a piece of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is a piece of the National Highway System, a system of roadways that are viewed as fundamental to the nation's economy, resistance, and versatility by the Federal Highway Administration. 

By 1914, a cleared province street associated Vallejo and Benicia north of the Carquinez Strait, after the present Maine Street, Benicia Road, Columbus Parkway, and K Street. In spite of the fact that state thruways were assigned to Benicia in 1910 (Legislative Route (LRN) 7, presently I-680) and Vallejo in 1931 (LRN 74, presently SR 29), this association was not included until 1935, when LRN 74 (an unsigned assignment) was stretched out east from Vallejo to Benicia and north along previous Route 7 to Fairfield. (A short goad associating Vallejo to the Carquinez Bridge was added to Route 74 of every 1937.) LRN 74 at first entered Benicia on K Street and left on East Fifth Street, making a few turns in the middle. Two realignments were worked during the 1940s, lessening the quantity of swings to one, at the side of L and East Second Streets. 

On September 15, 1955, the Bureau of Public Roads endorsed the Interstate Highway System goads and associations in urban zones. Among these was a circle around the San Francisco Bay, before long numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) joined various existing administrative courses, including Routes 69, 108, 107, 75, and 74, crossing the Carquinez Strait on the proposed Benicia-Martinez Bridge and completion at I-80 close downtown Vallejo. The main bit of this road north of the Carquinez Strait was at the I-80 cloverleaf exchange, worked in the late 1950s when I-80 was redesigned through Vallejo. This was an incredibly short roadway, starting at Lemon Street, crossing under I-80 and Laurel Street, and closure at Reis Avenue and Cedar Street. In around 1960, it was stretched out east to the old interstate (Columbus Parkway) between the urban areas, and was finished to the new scaffold in around 1962, the year the extension opened. 

In the 1964 renumbering, the administrative assignment of the finished Vallejo-Benicia expressway was changed from Route 74 to Route 680, mirroring its Interstate assignment. The short bit of non-expressway in Vallejo, stretching out west from I-80 to SR 29, progressed toward becoming State Route 141. This course pursued Benicia Road and Maine Street, a similar arrangement the state roadway had constantly taken; it at first associated with I-780 by means of Lemon Street, however later pursued Benicia Road from I-80 north of I-780. In 1975, a proposed (and never developed) expansion west and north to SR 37 east of the Napa River was added to Route 141. The course was to be the Waterfront Freeway, downsized to a road in 1974. 

The Federal Highway Administration endorsed a movement of I-680 onto the State Route 21 expressway among Benicia and Fairfield in July 1973. To keep the course to Vallejo in the Interstate framework, it was renumbered I-780; the comparing administrative changes were made in 1976. As a feature of the venture to build another northbound Benicia-Martinez Bridge, the I-680/I-780 exchange was modified; the new range opened in August 2007. Highway 141 was erased from the state interstate framework in 1988, not long after the city of Vallejo developed Curtola Parkway over (supplanting Maryland Street) just toward the south, straightforwardly interfacing I-780 with a surface street to SR 29.
