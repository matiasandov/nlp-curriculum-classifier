"A.A.R.M." was composed by official maker Brent Forrester, denoting his eleventh composition credit for the arrangement, his first since the prior season scene, "Work Bus". It was coordinated by ordinary "Office" supervisor David Rogers, denoting his ninth coordinating credit, and first since the prior season scene "Junior Salesman". The scene was initially expected to air as a half-hour scene, however NBC later declared it is extended to fill an hour vacancy. Dissimilar to the past scenes that were extended, such as "Proceeding onward" and "Livin' the Dream", "A.A.R.M." considers two delivered scenes. 

This scene visitor stars Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, Mark McGrath, Santigold, and Jessica St. Clair. So as to get them, the show contacted "a little gathering of famous people that [the producers] thought would be great". Both Aiken and Santigold acknowledged. Baumgartner then asked Rodgers, who was a companion, and he acknowledged. McGrath later ended up accessible, and he was picked too. Angela's child, Phillip, was played by twins Vince and Evan Edwards. The tyke that shot the scene in which Phillip picked the beet was just expected to point to the beet. At last, the kid said "beet!", which Rogers called "astounding". The voice of the documentarian that reacts to Jim is that of scene chief David Rogers. Rogers likewise voiced a similar character in the season opener "New Guys". Initially, showrunner and arrangement maker Greg Daniels had re-recorded the line in "New Guys", yet wound up preferring Roger's voice better. He requested that he repeat the job in "A.A.R.M." to protect congruity. 

Jules Kmetzko planned the representations of Dwight and Mose, just as Dwight's purposeful publicity picture. He had recently made Pam's watercolor of Dunder Mifflin that held tight the dividers. The majority of the moves were arranged by Mary Ann Kellogg, who had arranged huge numbers of the arrangement's move substantial scenes. The snag course in the stockroom was made by Rogers and Forrester, with contribution from the show's specialty office. Wilson likewise helped, since he in the long run was the person who went through it; it was his plan to have the course end on a raised palette of boxes. Initially, the course should be in the parking area, yet Rogers moved it, feeling that the stockroom was "increasingly natural" and that the warmth would have been hindering to the completed item. The plan to have Jim at long last give Pam his card had been considered in the scholars' space for quite a while, however just amid "A.A.R.M." did the journalists feel it was the ideal time.

Rogers conceded that the Pam and Jim video was enlivened by various fan recordings that exist on the web.

Likewise, the deterrent course was not an immediate reference to the second season scene "Office Olympics", in spite of the fact that Rogers comprehended that there were likenesses. 

Jim references both Michael J. Fox and the 1985 film "Back to the Future" amid his "drivel" gathering room meeting. Dwight understands that Phillip is his child after the kid takes a gander at a little scale reproduction of the Battlestar "Galactica", anecdotal ship from the sci-fi arrangement of a similar name, similarly that Dwight does. Dwight's test to check whether Phillip is his child has been contrasted with a comparable scene in the 1997 film "Kundun", in which Tibetan priests practice a comparative custom. To prevail upon Kevin, Angela and Oscar imagine that infant Phillip gave him an iTunes gift voucher. Darryl and the remainder of the workplace move to the tune "Boogie Wonderland" by Earth, Wind, and Fire. The show Andy tries out for "America's Next A Cappella Sensation", is a spoof of famous singing shows like "American Idol", "The Voice", and "The Sing-Off". The anecdotal show is facilitated by Mark McGrath, the lead artist from the musical gang Sugar Ray. The judges for the show incorporate Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, and Santigold. Rodgers is an American football quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, Aiken is a vocalist who picked up noticeable quality after the second period of "American Idol" in 2003, and Santigold is an American artist, musician, and maker. Andy sings both the Cornell University institute of matriculation ("Far Above Cayuga's Waters"), just as "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from the melodic "Annie".

Furthermore, Cornet was content with Dwight's proposition and the move party that flagged Darryl's leaving, calling the last "a cut of rapture". 

Erik Adams of "The A.V. Club" gave the scene a "B+". He said that "what benefits 'AARM' generally ... is a simple Jim-and-Dwight storyline" that represented the development that the characters have encountered over the most recent nine years. He composed that there were many delicate minutes in the scene, for example, Dwight and Jim's showdown, Pam and Jim's reaffirmation of adoration, and Dwight's proposition to Angela. He reasoned that "It's that mix of fresh starts and shutting circles that makes 'AARM' a powerful second-to-last part of "The Office"".

Cornet called the grouping "powerful". Rick Porter of Zap2it composed that it was a "decent move" with respect to the scholars for "not telling us what Jim composed on the card from 'Christmas Party' [because] it must be really epic." 

Alternately, most faultfinders gave Andy's plot a negative audit. Sepinwall called the whole plot "godawfulness". Campbell alluded to it as "an average story that remained as a distinct difference to the enthusiastic timbre of the remainder of the scene". Cornet called the scenes "similarly as detached from the center of the show as that character has for quite a while."
