"The Simpsons"' maker Matt Groening thought it was a "quintessential" Swartzwelder scene, and official maker/show sprinter David Mirkin said it was an "awesome occupation by a standout amongst the most productive scholars of the show". The most vital thing to Mirkin while making the scene was to ensure that the elephant would be a "jerk" and carry on discourteously, in contrast to different creatures on the show. For instance, rather than putting individuals on his back, Stampy would place them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant "never fully bonds since it's an extremely quarrelsome creature, an idea that was imperative to this scene". Stampy has since been utilized a few times in jokes later on in the arrangement. For instance, Stampy showed up in the season nine scene "Marvel on Evergreen Terrace" in one Bart had always wanted, and in the season fourteen scene "Huge Marge", where he is utilized by Bart in a trick to help Krusty the Clown win back his ubiquity.

As Bart cleans, he incidentally scours the paint off an "American Gothic" painting holding tight the divider. Under the paint is a message marked by the painter, Grant Wood, perusing: "In the event that you can peruse this, you cleaned excessively hard." 

The scene in which Stampy's eye is seen through a window of the Simpson family's home is like a scene with a Tyrannosaurus rex in the film "Jurassic Park". While cleaning the house, Marge turns on the radio and the tune "Sixteen Tons" by Merle Travis is heard.

Homer peruses an old "television Guide" in which the rundown of a scene of "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C." peruses "Gomer upsets Sgt. Carter", a conceivable summary for each scene of that arrangement. He likewise envisions the scene with an idea of both Carter and Pyle remaining by one another. Carter hollers, "Pyle!" and Pyle reacts, "Shazam!".
