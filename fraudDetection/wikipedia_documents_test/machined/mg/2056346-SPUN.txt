There, he met and become a close acquaintence with the genuine Sergeant Seymour Skinner, who turned into his guide and helped him discover significance in his vexed life. Seymour revealed to Armin that his fantasy was to turned into a grade school vital after the war. Afterward, Seymour was pronounced missing and assumed dead. Armin took the updates on the clear passing to Seymour's mom, Agnes. After gathering him, be that as it may, Agnes confused him with her child, and Armin couldn't stand to convey the message. He rather permitted Agnes to call him Seymour, and assumed control over Seymour's life. In the interim, the genuine Seymour Skinner went through five years in a POW camp, at that point worked in a Chinese sweatshop for two decades until it was closed somewhere near the United Nations.

Oakley said he and Weinstein "went through a month submerged in the psyche of Seymour Skinner" to set up that scene, and starting now and into the foreseeable future, accepted each open door to "tinker with [Skinner's] identity and his backstory and his homelife". 

Portraying the genuine Seymour Skinner, Keeler commented, "It would have been anything but difficult to make him an extremely awful, frightful, dislikeable person, yet we didn't do that. We made him just not exactly right, not exactly Skinner, and a tad off." Bill Oakley said the thought behind the character was that he "just needed flair". The makers chose Martin Sheen to voice the character since they appreciated his execution in "End of the world Now" and felt his voice would be fitting for a Vietnam veteran. 

Keeler obtained the name Armin Tamzarian from a cases agent who had helped him after an auto crash when he moved to Los Angeles. Notwithstanding, the genuine Tamzarian (presently a California Superior Court Judge) was uninformed his name was being utilized until after the scene publicized.

Turner takes note of that the scene "still games a few virtuoso stiflers", yet says that such minutes are restricted. 

In July 2007, in an article in "The Guardian", Ian Jones contends that the "show ended up idiotic" in 1997, indicating "The Principal and the Pauper" as the bellwether. "Could you repeat that? A noteworthy character in a long-running arrangement gets exposed as a fake? It was modest, inactive narrating", he comments. 

In a February 2006 article in "The Star-Ledger", Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz refer to the scene while attesting that the nature of "The Simpsons" "gets a lot spottier" in season nine. Alan Sepinwall sees in another "Star-Ledger" article, "[The episode] was implausible to the point that even the characters were denying it before the finish of the scene."

In an April 2001 meeting, Harry Shearer, the voice of Principal Skinner, reviewed that subsequent to perusing the content, he told the authors, "That is "so" off-base. You're taking something that a group of people has fabricated eight years or nine years of interest in and just hurled it in the junk can without any justifiable cause, for a story we've done before with different characters. It's so self-assertive and unwarranted, and it's ill bred to the gathering of people." 

In a December 2006 meeting, Shearer included, "Presently, [the writers] decline to discuss it. They understand it was a loathsome misstep. They never notice it. It resembles they're rebuffing [the audience] for focusing." In the prologue to the ninth season DVD boxset, arrangement maker Matt Groening portrays "The Principal and the Pauper" as "one of [his] least most loved scenes". He likewise called the scene "an error" in a meeting with "Moving Stone". 

Conversely, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the creators of "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide", lauded the scene, calling it "one of the arrangement's unequaled best scenes, predominantly on the grounds that it demonstrates to us a human side, of Principal Skinner, yet of his hectorish Mom also."

Ken Keeler, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein all shield the scene in its DVD discourse. Keeler declares, "I am extremely, exceptionally glad for the activity I did on this scene. This is the best scene of TV I believe I at any point composed." He portrays the scene as a discourse on "individuals who like things simply the manner in which they are", and comments, "It never appears to have jumped out at anybody that this scene is about the general population who loathe it." However, Keeler says that a portion of the exchange was transformed from his unique draft, making this point more subtle. Oakley and Weinstein disclose that they needed to push the limits of the arrangement while filling in as show-sprinters, and encourage watchers to treat "The Principal and the Pauper" as a "try". They gather that the negative gathering was mostly because of the way that it was not quickly clear to watchers this was such a scene (rather than, for instance, "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"). They likewise portray the completion of the scene as an endeavor to reset the coherence and enable fans to consider the scene as non-sanctioned, separated from the bigger arrangement.
