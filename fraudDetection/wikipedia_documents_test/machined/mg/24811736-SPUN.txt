The arrangement was the possibility of official makers Diederick Santer, who needed a show where customary "EastEnders" characters would be out of sight, and John Yorke, who needed to improve the depiction of youngsters in "EastEnders" and to get more youthful individuals composing for it. 

The show's authors, all newcomers matured somewhere in the range of 17 and 22, were chosen through a composition rivalry, and made the arrangement at a BBC summer school.
