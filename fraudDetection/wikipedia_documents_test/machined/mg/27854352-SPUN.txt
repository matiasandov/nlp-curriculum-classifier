In the mid year of 1968, under what "Sesame Street" analysts Edward Palmer and Shalom Fisch called Lesser's "capable initiative", five three-day educational programs arranging workshops were led in Boston. The motivation behind the workshops, gone to by instructive specialists and the new show's authors and makers, was to determine which school-planning abilities to underscore.

Field explore testing the adequacy of every scene's substance was directed at preschools, preceding communicate. The show's instructive objectives were estimated after every scene circulated to additionally assess the show's adequacy.

Dissipated all through the book are kid's shows drawn by kids' writer Maurice Sendak, who went to the 1968 courses. 

Lesser starts his book by portraying the source of "Sesame Street" and his part in it. He had been examining tyke advancement and how its ideas could be utilized to show kids; since 1961, he contemplated youngsters' response to TV and whether the medium could be utilized to instruct them. In 1966, he was drawn closer by Cooney and Morrisett to help them in making the new show's instructive destinations and research objectives, and he concurred in spite of his hesitations about the viability of TV as an educating device. 

"Sesame Street's" gathering of people incorporated any kid in the nation who wished to watch it, however Lesser reports that the makers' unique object was to achieve the poor offspring of America. Lesser states, "If the arrangement did not work for poor kids, the whole undertaking would fall flat".

Antoine de Saint-ExupÄÅ¡ry, "The Little Prince". 

Gerald Lesser utilized this statement to start the second segment of "Kids and Television". He presented a significant number of his areas and sections with relevant statements.

These sections diagram the logic behind "Sesame Street". The show's makers made suspicions about instructing and held the eccentric view that learning can be accidental and agreeable. At last, they chose that in spite of the fact that "Sesame Street" was set in a urban setting, they would abstain from portraying more cynicism than what was at that point present in the youngster's condition. Lesser states, "With all its boisterousness and droll cleverness, "Sesame Street" turned into a sweet show, and its staff keeps up that there is nothing incorrectly in that". 

The scientists built up an "Author's Notebook" for the show's scholars and makers to fill in as an extension between educational programs objectives and content improvement. Lesser interfaces the show's creation techniquesÃ¢ÂÂincluding the utilization of music, humor (particularly droll funniness), and animationÃ¢ÂÂwith instructive objectives.

As indicated by Lesser, "Sesame Street" consolidates four components to support consideration: Muppets, the cast of live grown-ups and youngsters on the set, liveliness, and real to life film.

Utilizing outside research bunches like the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the Workshop needed to discover if watching the show had any effect. They were especially keen on contrasting the show's impact on kids from various financial gatherings, and if seeing conditions influenced its adequacy. 

Lesser states, "This turned into the first run through in TV's 25-year history that tyke viewing was efficiently connected over a supported period to the plan of a broadcast arrangement for youngsters". Lesser depicts the new techniques scientist Edward Palmer made to think about the impacts "Sesame Street" had on its young watchers; for instance, the "distractor", in which a slide projector was set beside a TV and acclimated to change slides at regular intervals. The scientists recorded when kids in their investigation moved their consideration far from the TV to the projector, and the information gathered were dissected. Sections were expelled dependent on the data accumulated. "This was the first run through in TV's history that the youngsters themselves would be tuned in to with consideration as a TV arrangement for them was planned and communicate", Lesser states.

They found that the youngsters who viewed the most took in the most. 

The last segment of Lesser's book, "Exercises from Sesame Street", abridges what the makers and analysts were endeavoring to do.

Terry Barrett of Ohio State University calls "Kids and Television" a "genuine book", something that could be perused by the overall population without trading off the field of instruction. Barrett additionally calls the book an enlightening treatment of a "fascinating contemporary instructive wonder". Joan Tierney of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation calls the book "a well-thought, efficient recorded variant" of the early history and advancement of "Sesame Street". She not just considers the book a "how-to" in how to make and create a youngsters' network show, yet in addition an imperative presentation to the open the diligent work and commitment it required to put it reporting in real time. For Tierney, the most fascinating piece of the story Lesser tells in the book is the way individuals with solid and diverse feelings and personalities figured out how to cooperate and to give TV "a smidgen of class". She acclaims Lesser for including the CTW's depreciators, yet trusts that he pointlessly incorporated the more crazy reactions so as to give "Sesame Street "and the Workshop greater validity. Rose K. Goldsen of Cornell University censures Lesser for legitimizing "the bizarre society conviction that keeping legend in a tyke's head is equivalent to teaching a kid".
