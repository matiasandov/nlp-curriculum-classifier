Near the wellspring of the River Irk, close undulating area at the lower regions of the South Pennines, it is northwest of Oldham, southeast of Rochdale and upper east of Manchester. 

Truly part of Lancashire, Royton and its environment have given proof of old British, Roman and Viking action in the region. Amid the Middle Ages, Royton framed a little township focused on Royton Hall, a home claimed by a long progression of dignitaries which incorporated the Byrons and Radcliffes. A settlement extended outwards from the corridor which, by as late as 1780, "contained just a couple of straggling and mean-fabricated houses". Cultivating was the principle business of this rustic territory, with local people enhancing their salaries by hand-loom woolen weaving in the household framework. 

Royton has the refinement of being the main town where a controlled cotton plant was worked; at Thorp in 1764, and is one of the principal territories on the planet to have received the production line framework. The presentation of material production amid the Industrial Revolution encouraged a procedure of impromptu urbanization in the region, and by the mid-nineteenth century Royton had developed as a factory town. At its peak, there were 40Ã¢Â cotton millsÃ¢ÂÂsome of the biggest in the United KingdomÃ¢ÂÂemploying 80% of the neighborhood populace. Imports of outside cotton products started the decrease in Royton's material industry amid the mid-twentieth century, and its last plant shut in 1998.

The old Britons are thought to have possessed the zone, and the Romans to have crossed it; the remaining parts of a Roman or Early Medieval bloomery was found in 1836. There is no physical sign of the Vikings/Norsemen in the region, yet toponymic proof suggests they have been available; the villa of Thorp is the most established settled area in Royton, and its name is of Old Norse source signifying "ranch, home or town". 

Unmentioned in the "Domesday Book" of 1086, Royton does not show up in records until 1212, when it was reported to have been a thegnage home, or estate, including twelve oxgangs of land, with a yearly rate of 24Ã¢Â shillings payable by the inhabitant, William Fitz William, to King John. From William, who kicked the bucket in 1223, Royton go to his child Thomas, who was as yet alive in 1254. Thomas' girl Margery, who wedded Alexander Luttrell of Somerset, sold most of Royton and its remote land to John de Byron in around 1260. It is from this trade the Byron family came to utilize Royton as their central spot of habitation until the early piece of the seventeenth century. 

The early history of Royton is connected intimately with what was then its lodge, Royton Hall, which was occupied by the Byron family for over 350Ã¢Â years. Amid that period the Byrons' association in territorial and national issues added esteem to what was generally a dark and provincial township. John de Byron was an observer to the contract of joining of 1301, which raised the township of Manchester to the status of a ward. A relative of JohnÃ¢ÂÂJohn ByronÃ¢ÂÂserved as High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1572, and was knighted by Elizabeth I in 1579. John filled in as Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire at the season of the Spanish Armada, and sourced infantry from Royton towards the English military. His child, additionally called John, battled amid the English Civil War in favor of the Cavaliers. His activities prompted making him John Byron, first Baron Byron of Rochdale by method for a peerage allowed by King Charles I. Following the regicide of Charles I, and the ascent of Cromwellian England, Baron Byron's assets, incorporating his properties in Royton, were appropriated. Royton Hall was then acquired by Thomas Percival, a rich cloth producer whose relatives kept on involving the lobby until around 1814. The lobby was then acquired by the Radcliffe Baronets. 

Aside from the dignitaries who lived in Royton Hall, the number of inhabitants in Royton amid the Middle Ages contained a little network of retainers and ranchers, a large portion of whom were included with field, yet enhanced their earnings by weaving woolens in the local framework. The territory was meagerly populated and comprised of a few villas, including Thorp, Heyside and Royton town itself as the core. Amid the Early Modern time frame, the weavers of Royton had been utilizing turning wheels in temporary weavers' cabins, however as both the interest for cotton products expanded and the innovation of cotton-turning hardware improved amid the mid eighteenth century, the requirement for bigger structures to house greater, better and progressively effective gear ended up obvious.

The development of more plants pursued, which started a procedure of urbanization and financial change in the locale; the populace moved far from cultivating, embracing work in the production line framework. The presentation of the production line framework prompted a ten times increment of Royton's populace in under a century; from 260 of every 1714 to 2,719 out of 1810. In spite of its development as an inside for cotton-material generation, and the development of a house of prayer of straightforwardness in 1754, in 1780 Royton was said to have "contained just a couple of straggling and mean-fabricated bungalows". The general population of Royton kept on delivering cotton merchandise (for the most part fabric) and offer them at the market in Manchester. 

Amid this time of development, Royton's parliamentary portrayal was restricted to two individuals from parliament for Lancashire, and broadly, the finish of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had brought about times of starvation and ceaseless joblessness for material weavers. By the start of 1819 the weight produced by poor financial conditions, combined with the absence of suffrage in northern England, had improved the intrigue of political Radicalism in the locale. The Manchester Patriotic Union, a gathering fomenting for parliamentary change, started to arrange a mass open exhibition in Manchester to request the change of parliamentary portrayal.
