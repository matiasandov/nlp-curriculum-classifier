HMS "Campania" was a seaplane delicate and plane carrying warship, changed over from an old sea liner by the Royal Navy right off the bat in the First World War. After her change was finished in mid-1915 the ship invested her energy leading preliminaries and activities with the Grand Fleet. These uncovered the requirement for a more drawn out flight deck to enable bigger airplane to take off, and she was altered as needs be. "Campania" missed the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, however made various watches with components of the Grand Fleet. She never observed battle and was before long consigned to a preparation job as a result of her older apparatus. In November 1918 "Campania" was secured with the capital boats of the Grand Fleet when an abrupt tempest made her grapple drag. With no second stay being laid, she hit a few of the boats and the impacts punctured her structure; she gradually sank, with no death toll. Her Officer of the Watch had neglected to call the Captain, and was rejected the ship. 

Initially worked as a traveler liner for Cunard Line's administration among Liverpool and New York in 1893, was the holder of the Blue Riband grant for speed right off the bat in her profession. In October 1914, she was sold to the shipbreakers Thos W Ward as she was wearing out. 

The Royal Navy obtained "Campania" from the shipbreakers on 27 November 1914 for ÃÅ32,500, at first for change to an outfitted dealer cruiser furnished with eight speedy shooting firearms. The ship was changed over by Cammell Laird to a plane carrying warship rather and the two forward 4.7-inch weapons were erased for a taking off deck. Two derricks were fitted on each side to exchange seaplanes between the water and the two holds. The amidships hold had the limit with regards to seven expansive seaplanes. The forward hold, underneath the flight deck, could fit four little seaplanes, however the flight deck must be lifted off the hold to get to the planes. HMS "Campania" was charged on 17 April 1915. 

The principal departure from the flight deck did not happen until 6 August 1915 when a Sopwith Schneider floatplane, mounted on a wheeled trolley, utilized of the flight deck while the ship was steaming into the breeze at . The Sopwith flying machine was the lightest and most noteworthy fueled flying machine in administration with the Royal Naval Air Service, and the narrow escape in a positive breeze exhibited that heavier air ship couldn't be propelled from the flight deck. 

By October 1915 "Campania" had practiced with the Grand Fleet multiple times, yet had just taken off flying machine multiple times as the North Sea was frequently unreasonably unpleasant for her seaplanes to utilize. Her skipper suggested that the taking off deck be protracted and given a more extreme slant to enable gravity to help the air ship's increasing speed and the ship was appropriately altered at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward pipe was part into two channels and the flight deck was stretched out among them and over the scaffold to a length of , with the goal that air ship from the two holds could utilize the flight deck. A canvas windscreen was given to enable the air ship to unfurl their wings out of the breeze, and a kite inflatable and the majority of its supporting hardware were included the toward the back hold. "Campania" presently conveyed seven Short Type 184 torpedo planes and three or four littler warriors or scouts; a Type 184 made its first departure from the flight deck on 3 June 1916, additionally utilizing a wheeled trolley. This achievement provoked the Admiralty to arrange the world's first air ship intended for bearer activities, the Fairey Campania. The ship got the first of these air ship in late 1917 where they joined littler Sopwith 1Ã¢Ë Strutter scouts. At different occasions "Campania" additionally conveyed the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup. 

"Campania" neglected to get the flag to send when the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow on 30 May 1916 in transit to the Battle of Jutland, however she cruised two hours and after fifteen minutes. Despite the fact that she was gradually surpassing the armada promptly toward the beginning of the day of 31 May, she was requested to come back to Scapa Flow as she did not have an escort and German submarines had been accounted for in the zone. The ship took an interest in some enemy of submarine and hostile to Zeppelin watches, however she was later proclaimed unfit for armada obligation as a result of her faulty hardware and turned into a seaplane preparing and swell station dispatch. In April 1918 "Campania", alongside the Grand Fleet, was exchanged from Scapa Flow to Rosyth. 

On the morning of 5 November 1918, "Campania" was lying at stay off Burntisland in the Firth of Forth. An unexpected Force 10 squall made the ship drag stay. She impacted first with the bow of the close-by warship , and after that scratched at the edge of the battlecruiser . "Campania"s body was broken by the underlying crash with "Regal Oak", flooding her motor room and closing off all principle electrical power. The ship at that point began to settle by the stern, and sank about five hours in the wake of breaking free. The ship's group were all protected by neighboring vessels. A Naval Board of Inquiry into the episode held "Campania"s watch officer generally in charge of her misfortune, refering to explicitly the inability to tie up once the ship began to float. 

The disaster area of HMS "Campania" was at first managed insurance under the Protection of Wrecks Act, being assigned in 2000. This assignment was disavowed in 2013 when the site was re-assigned as a Historic Marine Protected Area under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. The remaining parts of the four "Campania" flying machine and seven 1Ã¢Ë Strutters that she had on board when she sank are still buried in her disaster area.
