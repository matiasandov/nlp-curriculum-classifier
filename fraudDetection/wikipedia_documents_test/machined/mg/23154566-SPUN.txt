Activity Paula 

Unternehmen Paula (Undertaking or Operation Paula) is the German codename allowed for the Second World War "Luftwaffe" hostile activity to devastate the rest of the units of the "ArmÄÅ¡e de l'Air" (ALA), or French Air Force amid the Battle of France in 1940. On 10 May the German military ("Wehrmacht") started their intrusion of Western Europe. By 3 June, the British Army had pulled back from Dunkirk and the landmass in Operation Dynamo, the Netherlands and Belgium had surrendered and the greater part of the arrangements of the French Army were disbanded or devastated. To finish the thrashing of France, the Germans embraced a second stage task, "Fall Rot" (Case Red), to overcome the rest of the districts. So as to do this, air matchless quality was required. The "Luftwaffe" was requested to demolish the French Air Forces, while as yet offering help to the German Army. 

For the activity, the Germans submitted five Air Corps to the assault, involving 1,100 flying machine. The task was propelled on 3 June 1940. English knowledge had cautioned the French of the approaching assault, and the activity neglected to accomplish the vital outcomes wanted by the "Oberkommando der Luftwaffe" (High Command of the Air Force). In any case, the situation of the French ground and aviation based armed forces at this stage implied that the disappointment of the activity would not hinder the annihilation of France. 

After the affirmation of war on Nazi Germany by the United Kingdom and France, in the repercussions of the German intrusion of Poland, nine months of stalemate occurred along the Western Front named the Phony War. The main military activity was the French Army's Saar Offensive which was ended in dubious conditions. After the Polish Campaign, in October 1939, the organizers of the "Oberkommando der Luftwaffe" (Luftwaffe High Command) and the "Oberkommando der Wehrmacht" (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) turned their considerations to Western Europe. 

The Western Allies had surrendered the activity and the Germans would attack in 1940. A few plans were toyed with by the German General Staff. General Franz Halder, the head of staff of the Army, displayed the main arrangement for "Fall Gelb" ("Case Yellow") on 19 October 1939. The arrangement's German code was "Aufmarschanweisung NÃ¢Â°1, Fall Gelb", or "Organization Instruction No. 1, Case Yellow". The activity was a constrained task in which Luxembourg and the Low Countries were to be vanquished so as to give a base to advance tasks against France sometime in the not too distant future and added up to a less aggressive re-keep running of the notorious "Schlieffen Plan" which fizzled amid the First World War in 1914. It was dismissed by Adolf Hitler and at the turn of the year, Heinz Guderian's head of staff, Erich von Manstein protected Hitler's consideration with an altered adaptation. A driven push through the Ardennes was recommended by von Manstein. This primary assault would go through most of the mechanized and tank divisions (Panzer Divisions) in a drive to the English Channel. A redirection task in Belgium and the Netherlands would go before this push, to draw the Allied Armies, including the British Expeditionary Force, into a snare. 

Propelled on 10 May 1940, the overhauled form of "Unternehmen Gelb" (Operation Yellow), otherwise called the Manstein Plan, succeeded. Be that as it may, the British Army circumvented amid the Battle of Dunkirk. In any case, the Belgian Army, Dutch Army and the greater part of the tip top French powers were devastated in the enclosure. This left only below average French units to battle the whole German Army. The "Luftwaffe" had a vital influence in upsetting Allied activities in this early stage. The "Luftwaffe's" cooperation was especially vital amid the Battle of Sedan which empowered the German Army to complete Operation Yellow. By early June the Dunkirk attack was finished, and on 3 June, the Germans started arrangements for the triumph of the remainder of France under the codename "Fall Rot" (Case Red). For this to be as effective, air prevalence would be required first, as it had been amid Operation Yellow. 

Hugo Sperrle had since a long time ago arranged assaults upon Paris and on 22 May he requested "Fliegerkorps II" (Air Corps II) and "Fliegerkorps V" (Air Corps V) with "Kampfgeschwader 77" (Bomber Wing 77) and "Generaloberst" (General Colonel) Ulrich Grauert's "I Fliegerdivision", III./"Kampfgeschwader 28" (Bomber Wing 28) to bomb Paris. Terrible climate forestalled the activity. Resolved to proceed with his arrangements, Sperrle requested Otto Hoffmann von Waldau and Helmuth von Hoffman, "Gruppenkommandeur" (Group Commander) of III./KG 28, to design a task named "Paula" the next day, on 23 May 1940. 

The task was expansive in its degree. Just as dispensing with French runways and airplane production lines around Paris, in von Waldau's words, the besieging was to "accomplish an alluring impact on the spirit of the capital". German surveillance air ship revealed 1,244 air ship on landing strips in and around Paris, including 550Ã¢ÂÂ650 single motor airplane. This French air control was to be wrecked alongside the aeronautics industrial facilities in the region. French enemy of flying machine big guns (AAA) barriers were mapped from strategic to operational dimension, and knowledge of French ground safeguards was along these lines great. The task was expected to be done on 30 May, yet once more, awful climate counteracted it. 

The task was undermined by poor staff work and over the top trust in the "safe" "Puzzle machine". The British insight, to be specific Ultra, who had been perusing the German codes, admonished the French. On 30 May they blocked a message sent by Grauert talking about the plans he was making for his Corps. Adding to this release, the units included got inadequate requests for the attack. "Oberst" Johann-Volkmar Fisser, "Geschwaderkommodore" (Wing Commander) of KG 77 grumbled about this. He solicited the Headquarters from "VIII Fliegerkorps", just to be informed that the objective was "Paris". Sperrle reacted to his solicitation by expelling KG 77 from the request of fight. The British blocked Frisser's solicitation to "VIII Fliegerkorps", and passed it to the French. The French had captured comparative messages and accordingly they multiplied their air ship solidarity to 120 warriors. 

Units from both "Luftflotte 2" and "Luftflotte 3" (Air Fleet 1 and 2) were made accessible for the activity. "Kampfgeschwader" (Bomber Wings) and "Jagdgeschwader" (Fighter Wings) with flying machine from "Lehrgeschwader 1", (LG 1), "Kampfgeschwader 1" (KG 1), "Kampfgeschwader 2" (KG 2), "Kampfgeschwader 3" (KG 3), "Kampfgeschwader 4" (KG 4), "Kampfgeschwader 54" (KG 54), "Kampfgeschwader 55" (KG 55) and "Kampfgeschwader 76" (KG 76), escorted by contender air ship from "Jagdgeschwader 2" (JG 2), "Jagdgeschwader 26" (JG 26), "Jagdgeschwader 27" (JG 27), "Jagdgeschwader 53" (JG 53), "ZerstÄÅrergeschwader 2" (ZG 2) and "ZerstÄÅrergeschwader 76" (ZG 76) were to complete the assault. 

KG 1, ZG 76 and LG 1 were under the order of "I. Fliegerkorps". ZG 2, KG 3 and II./KG 2 were under the direction of "II. Fliegerkorps". what's more, III./KG 54 were under "IV. Fliegerkorps". served under "V. Fliegerkorps". also, JG 26 were under the direction of the "IX. Fliegerdivision". JG 2 and JG 27 were under the order of "VIII. Fliegerkorps". "JagdfliegerfÄÅºhrer 3" loaned JG 53 for the activity. 

Cut. furthermore, I./KG 2 moved to Trier-Euren for the assault. I./KG 2 worked from Wengerohr, and III./KG 2 was to work from Kirchenburg. Cut. worked from Schwabisch. I., II., III./KG 55 worked from Reims, Heilbronn and Eutingen individually. KG 3's, I., II., and III., Gruppe were based at Aschaffenburg, Schweinfurt and WÄÅºrzburg. These units were based at obscure French bases by 3 June. KG 4 and its units were based at GÄÅºtersloh, Fassberg and Delmenhorst. All things considered, some of KG 3's units moved to bases close Lille for the assault. KG 1's I., II., III., Gruppe were based at Giessen, Kirtorf and Ettinghausen. It likely that a portion of these units additionally moved to caught French landing strips by 3 June. It is conceivable they were based at RosiÄÂ¨res-en-Santerre. Just I./KG 54 participated in the strike from the "Geschwader" (Wing). was presumably situated in some place in northern France on 3 June. It was initially based at KÄÅln-Ostheim. The warrior units were based at the accompanying landing strips: Abbeville (ZG 76); Darmstadt, NeufchÄËteau, Freiburg (ZG 2); Le Touquet, La Capelle, ÄÂtaples (JG 26); Couvron, Oulchy-le-ChÄËteau, (JG 2); Guise (JG 27); ÄÂpernay, Douzy, Charleville-MÄÅ¡ziÄÂ¨res, La Selve (JG 53). 

KG 2 set up 99 planes for the attack and KG 55 submitted 66 aircraft from their three "Gruppen". Through and through the "Luftwaffe" handled 640 planes and 460 contenders. 

Entrusted with the safeguard of the more noteworthy Paris territory was the "Zone d'OpÄÅ rations AÄÅ¡riennes Nord" or Z.O.A.N (Northern Zone of Air Operations). Groupe de Chasse I/145 (Polish) equipped with Caudron C.714 warriors were based at Dreux. G.C. I/1 with Bloch MB.152s were based at Chantilly-Les Aigles. G.C. II/1 Bloch 152s were sent to BrÄÅ¡tigny-sur-Orge runway. G.C. II/10 Bloch 152s were situated at Bernay-en-Ponthieu, while G.C. III/10 Bloch 152s were based at Deauville. More contender units working the Dewoitine D.520 are likewise recorded on the request of fight: G.C. I/3 at MeauxÃ¢ÂÂEsbly, G.C. II/3 at La FertÄÅ¡-sur-ChiersÃ¢ÂÂGaucher, G.C. III/3 with the D.520 and Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 at Illiers-l'ÄÂvÄÅque. Further units were situated along the line. G.C. I/4 with Curtiss H-75s at ÄÂvreux-Fauville, G.C. II/4 Curtiss H-75 at Orconte, G.C. I/6 Morane 406s at LognesÃ¢ÂÂÄÂmerainville, G.C. III/7 (Morane 406s) at Coulommiers, G.C. I/8 Bloch 152s at Claye-Souilly, and G.C. II/9 Bloch 152s at Connantre. These units were bolstered by night contender units, ("Groupement de Chasse de Nuit", Night Hunting Group), E.C.M.J. 1/16, E.C.N. 1/13, 2/13, 3/13 and 4/13 outfitted with the Potez 631. With everything taken into account, these gatherings totalled 240 flying machine. Just 120 warriors were made accessible to counter German assaults. 

On 3 June, the French units were cautioned an hour prior to the German aircraft took off, however inferable from similarly poor staff work, few French squadrons heard the scramble flag when it was radioed from the Eiffel Tower and some were gotten on the ground. At last, just eighty took off to block the approaching German developments. German advancement was observed by shadowing Potez 631s, one of which was shot down. The Germans would duplicate this strategy while capturing United States Army Air Force (USAAF) overwhelming aircraft amid the Defense of the Reich crusade. Alongside French AAA resistances, the contenders shot down ten German airplane, including four planes. One of these machines was directed by "JagdfliegerfÄÅºhrer 3" ("Fighter Flying Leader 3") "Oberst" Gerd von Massow. He was supplanted by "Oberst" Werner Junck, until the previous' discharge by German powers on 12 June 1940. "Geschwaderkommodore" of KG 51, Josef Kammhuber, who was injured in real life and taken as a wartime captive, was brought down on this date, in spite of the fact that it isn't clear whether KG 51 was associated with "Paula". Kammhuber would be discharged after the French surrender. He was supplanted as "Geschwaderkommodore" of KG 51 by Fisser, authority of KG 77. Fisser was killed two months after the fact driving KG 51 amid the Battle of Britain. Somewhere around one source does not put in KG 51 on the request of fight. German arrangements assaulted twenty-eight railroads and marshaling yard focuses. All harm delivered was light. None were out of activity for over 24 hours. 

The greater part of the German aircraft had disregarded and had an elevation advantage over French contenders endeavoring to pick up tallness to capture. Encounters were rare, however some French units endured substantial misfortunes. For the assault, the Germans had utilized the new C-250 "Flammbombe" (Flame Bomb) which had just been cleared for utilize 24 hours sooner. The ignitable bomb did some harm to shelters and stopped air ship. 

The Germans trusted they had struck a human blow against the ALA. German post-activity examination showed a reverberating achievement. It recommended an extensive rundown of destroyed French industrial facilities and obliterated airplane on the ground and noticeable all around. The Germans professed to have wrecked 75 French flying machine noticeable all around and 400 on the ground. Such was the apparent achievement, the "Luftwaffe" focused against ports on the northern French coast from that point. The harm incurred by the "Luftwaffe" was far not exactly the Germans thought. Just 20 French flying machine (16 of them warriors) were devastated on the ground and 15 of their contenders were shot down in aeronautical battle, a misfortune rate of 19 percent, proposing German over guaranteeing of over 4:1 noticeable all around and 16:1 on the ground. Six of the sixteen landing strips hit announced genuine harm, while fifteen production lines detailed slight harm. French setbacks on the ground were overwhelming, including 254 dead and 652 harmed. The French shot down 10 German air ship, including four aircraft. They guaranteed 16, recommending common over asserting. A further 21 vehicles were pulverized. All the French landing strips were back in task 48 hours after the fact. 

In spite of the fact that the task neglected to accomplish its objectives, the principal period of the German intrusion, Operation Yellow, had stripped the French Army of its best arrangements. The French powers holding the Somme line were for the most part save divisions of less fortunate quality and unsupported by substantial mounted guns, tanks or mechanized infantry. The disappointment of the German air activity did not keep the German Army from overcoming the French in June 1940, or the "Luftwaffe" in picking up air amazingness toward the start of "Fall Rot". The principle purpose behind German prevalence noticeable all around was the poor province of French air units' operational preparation. The "Luftwaffe" had a littler edge of numerical predominance over the ALA toward the beginning of "Fall Rot" as the French aeronautics industry was beginning to achieve maximum capacity underway. Somewhere in the range of 2,000 French flying machine were accessible regardless of the loss of 787 air ship (473 contenders, 120 planes and 194 observation air ship). The French had 2,086 machines accessible on 5 June 1940, the principal day of "Fall Rot", yet segment generation did not coordinate the creation of airframes. It was moderate and poor, and accordingly just 599 air ship (340 warriors and 170 planes) were workable; a rate of only 29 percent. After the opening of the hostile, the "Luftwaffe" "went crazy" over French air space. Such was the prevalence of the "Luftwaffe" by then, a few units were sent home to Germany to refit. The French crumbled inside and out only 22 days after the fact, and on 25 June France gave in.
