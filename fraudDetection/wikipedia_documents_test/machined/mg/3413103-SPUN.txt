Wulfred 

Wulfred (kicked the bucket 24 March 832) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in medieval England. Nothing is known about his life preceding 803, when he went to a congregation gathering, yet he was presumably an aristocrat from Middlesex. He was chosen diocese supervisor in 805 and invested his energy in office improving the pastorate of his house of God. He likewise fought with two back to back Mercian kingsÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ Coenwulf and CeolwulfÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ about whether laymen or ministry should control religious communities. At a certain point, Wulfred went to Rome to counsel with the papacy and was dismissed from office for various years over the issue. After Coenwulf's passing, relations were to some degree better with the new lord Ceolwulf, yet improved significantly more after Ceolwulf's ensuing affidavit. The debate about control of the cloisters was not completely settled until 838, after Wulfred's demise. Wulfred was the principal ecclesiastical overseer to put his representation on the coinage he struck. 

The fundamental hotspots for Wulfred's life are the enduring sanctions which notice him, various archives from his suffragan religious administrators promising submission, the records of a congregation board he managed, and the coinage he issued. 

Wulfred is accepted to have originated from Middlesex and to have been an individual from a well off and critical family with significant landholdings in Middlesex and neighboring areas. Albeit prior students of history felt that Wulfred originated from the Kentish honorability, it never again gives the idea this was so. A brother, Werhard, claimed property close Hayes, and Wulfred later possessed property there moreover. Other proof recommends that he was identified with an honorable family that claimed terrains in Harrow and Twickenham just as Hayes. 

Wulfred was archdeacon of the network at Christ Church, Canterbury before the demise of his ancestor ÄÂthelhard on 12 May 805. Wulfred went to a synod as an individual from ÄÂthelhard's staff in 803, however this is the main notice of Wulfred in the chronicled record. On 26 July 805, he went to a synod and was named "diocese supervisor choose" on the reports identifying with the gathering choices. Wulfred was blessed diocese supervisor on 3 August 805, or maybe in October or later in 805. He may have owed his height to Canterbury to the way that the kingdom of Mercia ruled Kent and Canterbury right now. 

One of Wulfred's primary articles as diocese supervisor was the renewal of the basilica part of CanterburyÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ that of Christ Church. A primary fundamental was the foundation of shared life for the church in the house of prayer part. This exertion was demonstrated on that of Bishop Chrodegang of Metz. By 813, Wulfred was at that point guaranteeing in a report that he had "resuscitated the heavenly religious community of the congregation of Canterbury by recharging, reestablishing and remaking it". Wulfred may have based the standard of the network on Chrodegang's "Regula canonicorum", or maybe on the standard of Benedict. His endeavors including requiring the pastorate to eat together, to give over their own property to the section, and guaranteeing that the standard hours were kept as a component of the formality. Despite the fact that plainly a collective style of living was rehearsed, regardless of whether the church building pastorate were changed into groups or on the off chance that they remained priests is hazy. Afterward, Wulfred allowed land to the part, however the blessings would just be substantial as long as the section kept to the new models. Wulfred additionally utilized his own riches to finance the development of new structures. 

Wulfred collided with King Coenwulf of Mercia over the issue of whether laymen could control religious houses, with the ruler supporting the privileges of laymen to control cloisters. In 808 the papacy educated Charlemagne that Coenwulf had not yet made harmony with the ecclesiastical overseer, however by 809 they appear to have been on great terms; the two were engaged with a progression of land exchanges from 809 to 815. 

In 814, Wulfred ventured out to Rome to visit Pope Leo III. In spite of the fact that the careful idea of his business with the pope is obscure, it was likely associated with the issue that emerged between the diocese supervisor and Coenwulf over lay control of religious communities. He was joined by the diocesan of Sherborne, Wigberht. Laymen controlling religious communities had been standard for quite a long time, however in the 50 years or so before Wulfred moved toward becoming ecclesiastical overseer the congregation had started to attest command over cloisters. In England, this endeavor to verify control was showed in pronouncements made by synods at Clofesho in 803 and all the more particularly the synod of Chelsea in 816. Pressures over the Kentish ascetic places of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet achieved such a point, that Wulfred was denied of power by the ruler for a time of certain years; six as indicated by the report attracted up 825 account theÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ then victoriousÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ Canterbury perspective on the discussion, however four is maybe more probable. Wulfred still seen records as ecclesiastical overseer in 817, and by September 822, he was again directing as diocese supervisor, when he blessed King Ceolwulf of Mercia. Wulfred was crashed into outcast quickly sooner or later amid his suspension from office. Be that as it may, the question was as yet dynamic in the most recent long stretches of Coenwulf's rule, as at a board held maybe in 821, the lord compromised the diocese supervisor with outcast except if he yielded. Wulfred and the Canterbury people group battled Coenwulf overwhelmingly, sending government offices to the pope and coming up with falsifications to support them which indicated to have been issued by before rulers. 

Around 820 Coenwulf constrained Wulfred into a horrible settlement by which Wulfred dealt with the discussed religious communities in return for an extensive installment of gold and the passing of an extremely vast bequest to the lord. Nor did Coenwulf and his adherents rapidly surrender control of Minster and Reculver to the diocese supervisor. In September 822, Wulfred achieved a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf connoted by the sanctification of Ceolwulf as ruler, which had been postponed about a year as a result of the debate with the diocese supervisor. After Ceolwuf's testimony in 823 Wulfred's circumstance improved. The new Mercian lord, Beornwulf, directed another board at Clofesho in 825 where the contention was at long last settled to support Wulfred and a record of the entire clash up to that point was recorded. Coenwulf's girl Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid remuneration to Wulfred and lost command over the houses in Kent. Later in 825 (or potentially the next year), be that as it may, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex vanquished Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations among Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold, and coinage in Wulfred's name seems to have stopped for a period, however it had been reestablished before Wulfred's passing in 832. Last settlement of the discussion over lordship of religious communities came in 838 at Kingston, in no time before Egbert's passing. 

Wulfred kicked the bucket in 832, presumably on 24 March. The greater part of his riches was left to a brother, Werhard, who was to give the terrains to Christ Church after his very own passing. Werhard, who was an individual from the religious community of Christ Church, rose to the situation of "minister abbot" by the center long periods of the 830s. This is known from Wulfred's will, which gets by in a late duplicate. This report names Werhard as Wulfred's nephew, and calls him cleric. 

The Christ Church scriptorium was especially dynamic under Wulfred. In spite of the fact that the penmanship of the archives created amid Wulfred's archiepiscopate is very exquisite, the real substance of the contracts is set apart by terrible language and different mistakes. From this, the history specialist N. P. Streams has concluded that the church of the basilica were not educated in Latin, and would have likely been unfit to create new Latin works. 

Wulfred was the principal diocese supervisor to put his representation on the pennies struck in his name which, dissimilar to those of past ecclesiastical overseers, never made reference to the decision Mercian lord. Wulfred additionally revamped a few structures at Christ Church, Canterbury, despite the fact that it isn't known whether these were bolster structures, for example, the residence and obstinate, or on the off chance that he remade the house of prayer itself.
