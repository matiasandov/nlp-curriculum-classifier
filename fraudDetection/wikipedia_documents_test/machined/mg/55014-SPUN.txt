In his parody jobs, Nielsen represented considerable authority in depicting characters unaware of and complicit in their silly environment. Nielsen's execution in "Plane!" denoted his defining moment, which made him "the Olivier of satires" as per film commentator Roger Ebert, and prompting further accomplishment in the class with "The Naked Gun" film arrangement, in light of the prior fleeting TV arrangement "Police Squad!", in which Nielsen likewise featured.

Nielsen had two siblings; the senior, Erik Nielsen (1924Ã¢ÂÂ2008), was a long-term Canadian Member of Parliament, bureau priest, and Deputy Prime Minister of Canada from 1984 to 1986. 

Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was a performer known for his depiction of Dr. Christian in a radio arrangement of that name, and the ensuing TV arrangement and movies. In a 1994 "Boston Globe" article, Nielsen clarified, "I learned all around early that when I would make reference to my uncle, individuals would take a gander at me as though I were the greatest liar on the planet. At that point I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed definitely. So I started to feel that perhaps this acting business was not an awful thought, much as I was modest about it and positively without mettle in regards to it. My uncle kicked the bucket not very long after I was in a situation to know him. I lament that I had no way to realize him better." 

Nielsen lived for quite a long while in Fort Norman (presently Tulita) in the Northwest Territories, where his dad was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His dad was a harsh man who beat his better half and children, and Leslie ached to get away.

He described documentaries and plugs and the vast majority of his initial work as a sensational on-screen character was uneventful. Hal Erickson of Allmovie noticed that "a lot of Nielsen's initial work was undistinguished; he was only an attractive driving man in an industry overloaded with attractive driving men." In 1956, he made his component movie debut in the Michael Curtiz-coordinated melodic film "The Vagabond King". In the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer", Nielsen recalled Curtiz as "a cruel person, a beguiling perverted person, however a twisted person". Nielsen called this film ""The Vagabond Turkey"". In spite of the fact that the film was not a triumph, maker Nicholas Nayfack offered him a tryout for the sci-fi film "Taboo Planet", bringing about Nielsen's taking a long contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). 

"Prohibited Planet" turned into a moment achievement, and jobs in other MGM movies, for example, "Payment!" (1956), "The Opposite Sex" (1956) and "Sweltering Summer Night" (1957) pursued. In 1957 he won the lead job inverse Debbie Reynolds in the lighthearted comedy "Tammy and the Bachelor", which, as a "Chicago Tribune" pundit wrote in 1998, influenced individuals to think about Nielsen as a sensational performer and attractive sentimental lead. In any case, disappointed with the movies he was offered, calling the studios "a Tiffany, which had overlooked how to make silver", Nielsen left MGM in the wake of trying out for Messala in the 1959 "Ben-Hur". Stephen Boyd got the job. In the wake of leaving the studios, Nielsen handled the lead job in the Disney miniseries "The Swamp Fox", as American Revolutionary War saint Francis Marion. In a 1988 meeting, he thought about the arrangement, saying, "That was an incredible encounter, on the grounds that the Disney individuals didn't do their shows like every other person, thumping out a scene seven days. ... We just needed to complete a scene a month, and the financial plans were amazingly high for TV around then. We had area shooting as opposed to shabby studio settings, and exceptionally genuine outfits." Eight scenes were delivered and broadcast somewhere in the range of 1959 and 1961. 

His TV appearances incorporate "Equity", "Alfred Hitchcock Presents", "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea", "The Virginian", and "The Wild West".

His last sensational job before primarily satire jobs was the 1979 Canadian debacle film "City on Fire", in which he played a degenerate civic chairman. In 1980, he visitor featured as Sinclair on the CBS miniseries "The Chisholms". 

Nielsen's supporting job of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's "Plane!" was a defining moment in his vocation. The film, a satire of fiasco movies, for example, "Party time!" and "Air terminal", depended on structure a parody around on-screen characters known for emotional jobs. Different stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's empty conveyance diverged from the craziness encompassing him. Whenever asked, "Unquestionably you must be joking?", he reacted with a brief, "I am not kidding. What's more, don't call me Shirley." In a few meetings, he pondered the line: "I thought it was entertaining, however it never jumped out at me that it would turn into a trademark. It's such a surpriseÃ¢Â ... the thing turns out, individuals state, 'What did he say?! Nielsen said he was "satisfied and respected that [he] got an opportunity to convey that line." As of 2010, the comedic trade was at number 79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.

For Nielsen, "Plane!" denoted a move from emotional jobs to dull satire. When it was recommended his job in "Plane!" was against sort, Nielsen challenged that he had "dependably been cast against sort previously", and that parody was what he constantly needed to do. Similar executives cast Nielsen in a comparable style, in their TV arrangement "Police Squad!". The arrangement presented Nielsen as Frank Drebin, the clichÃ© cop demonstrated after genuine characters in prior police arrangement. 

"Police Squad's" opening arrangement depended on the 1950s show "M Squad", which featured Lee Marvin, and opened with film of a squad car wandering through a dim urban setting with a major band playing a jazz tune out of sight. The Hank Simms voice-over and the show's association into acts with an epilog was respect to Quinn Martin police dramatizations including "The Fugitive", "The Streets of San Francisco", "Barnaby Jones", "The F.B.I.", and "Gun". Nielsen depicted a genuine character whose jokes seemed unintentional alongside the pratfalls and sight chokes that were going on around him. In spite of the fact that the show endured just six scenes, Nielsen got an Emmy Award designation for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. 

Six years after crossing out of "Police Squad!", the film "" returned Nielsen to his job as Frank Drebin. It included a heartless medication ruler attempting mesmerizing to kill Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did his very own large number tricks: "You have a thought of how you will accomplish something, and it's your visionÃ¢Â ... except if you do it, it truly doesn't stand an opportunity." This motion picture netted over $78Ã¢Â million and was generally welcomed by faultfinders. Ebert's 3Ã¢ËÃ¢ÂÂstar survey (out of four) noted, "You snicker, and after that you chuckle at yourself for giggling." 

"The Naked Gun" brought forth two continuations: "" (1991) and "" (1994). "Bare Gun 2Ã¢Ë" earned more than the first, with $86.9 million, while "Stripped Gun 33Ã¢ÂÂ" netted $51.1 million.

"On the off chance that there hasn't been one at this point, I question it. I figure it would be awesome." 

Nielsen quickly showed up on the World Wrestling Federation program in the late spring of 1994 on "WWF Monday Night Raw", gaining by Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were contracted as sleuths to disentangle the puzzle of the Undertaker, who had vanished at January's Royal Rumble occasion. At SummerSlam 1994, in a "Stripped Gun" spoof, they were sweltering working on this issue (actually, they were remaining on a case).

After "Plane!" and "The Naked Gun", Nielsen depicted comparably styled jobs in various different movies. These for the most part copied the style of "The Naked Gun" with shifting achievement and regularly focused on explicit movies; many were panned by commentators and most performed inadequately. "Repossessed" (1990) and "" (2001) were farces of "The Exorcist" and "", individually. Both endeavored ridiculous parody, yet were ineffectively gotten. Indeed, even a main job in a Mel Brooks comic frightfulness, "", neglected to produce much film industry energy, in spite of the fact that it gained a following in a later discharge to video. Both 1996's "Spy Hard" and 1998's "Improperly Accused", a farce of James Bond films and "The Fugitive", were prominent on record, yet not generally welcomed by faultfinders.
