In 1947Ã¢ÂÂ48, Harvey played with more youthful siblings Neil and Ray in two counterparts for Victoria, captaining the group in the second of these installations. Be that as it may, his very own structure started to disappear and he was dropped from the group halfway through the season. In 1948Ã¢ÂÂ49, Harvey stayed outside the primary decision group, and played in just two top of the line matches against Tasmania when Victoria handled a second-string group. He resigned toward the finish of the period, having played just 22 top of the line coordinates in an intruded on vocation.

As recreational offices and grass ovals were inadequate in thickly populated Fitzroy, Merv and his more youthful siblings played cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house.

They were generally joined by other nearby kids, two of whom wound up world class sportsmen: Allan Ruthven and Harold Shillinglaw. The gathering additionally played Australian guidelines football, kicking around moved up cardboard and paper. A significant part of the batting aptitude shown by the Harvey siblings has been ascribed to these diversions played on the erratic ricochet of the rough laneway. The surface additionally had a V-molded slant inwards towards the focal point of the path, making balls stray sideways subsequent to skipping. As the laneway implied that the playing territory was long and restricted, the young men additionally needed to figure out how to play the ball straight as per conventional cricket procedure. The Harveys played another type of cricket in their cemented patio utilizing a marble rather than a ball, and a scaled down bat. This honed their reflexes. 

Merv was the first of the siblings to go to the adjacent George Street State School and join the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they achieved their initial adolescents. The club had a program whereby they gave a decoration for each neighborhood school to grant to the best cricketer in their positions in that year. The fruitful understudy would then be offered access to the majority of the club's offices. The majority of the Harvey siblings were beneficiaries were of this award. At Fitzroy, they went under the impact of previous Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran chief Joe Plant. Merv and his more youthful kin had no formal instructing, and their dad, a customary nearness at the club, remained out of sight as their individual vocations created. Horace did not exhort his children on the most proficient method to bat, enabling them to figure their very own style and system. As indicated by the siblings, it was their mom who was vocal and outgoing, as opposed to their held dad. The young men who neglected to score runs were given kitchen obligation, and as indicated by them, their folks never demonstrated bias. 

Amid the winter, they played baseball for Fitzroy Baseball Club, regularly contending in matches played as drape raisers to the world class Australian guidelines football rivalry, the Victorian Football League.

Harvey graduated to Fitzroy's first XI in 1933Ã¢ÂÂ34. 

Amid the 1938Ã¢ÂÂ39 season, Harvey was chosen for the Victorian Second XI to play in a match against their partners from New South Wales.

Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the principal decision state group, he made 82 and 25. This was insufficient to persuade the state selectors and Harvey did not get a review to the Victorian group until the finish of the period when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He reacted by striking a profession best 163 to push his group to an innings win. 

Following the war, Harvey confronted a great deal of rivalry for a spot as an opening batsman in the Australian group, yet an opportunity emerged in 1946Ã¢ÂÂ47, when Bill Brown, who had captained Australia the past season and opened for the nation in Tests during the 1930s, was sidelined with damage for the entire summer.

They required 79 keeps running for triumph in 35 minutes on the last evening, and with brisk scoring required, the more forceful Keith Miller opened instead of Harvey. At the point when the principal wicket fell with the objective nearly finished, Harvey came in and made three not out when the match was finished.

After this, Harvey had two chances to press for choice for the following Test. He made 13 out of an innings triumph over Queensland and kept on being neglected. The second match was the Shield conflict with most outstanding adversaries New South Wales, which began on Boxing Day at the MCG. After the guests had made 205, Harvey opened with Ken Meuleman, who was out at 1/31, conveying Miller to the wrinkle. Mill operator pounded the bowling and Victoria were 1/154 by the day's end.

Merv made 30 and 44, neglecting to profit by his begins to make a major score with a Test opportunity calling; occupant opener Sid Barnes was harmed and inaccessible for the Fourth Test. 

By and by, Harvey was chosen to play his solitary Test, the Fourth Test at Adelaide, filling in for the harmed Barnes. Britain batted first and made 460 preceding being expelled late on the second day. Harvey opened with Arthur Morris, and made 12 in the main innings before being bowled by Bedser while playing a forceful shot. With just a couple of minutes of play left, the Australian chief Don Bradman came in and he also was bowled by Bedser, without scoring a run.

Harvey finished the season with 405 keeps running at 33.75. 

By 1947Ã¢ÂÂ48, Brown had recouped, so Harvey needed to contend with him just as Morris and Barnes for choice. In the primary match of the period against the visiting Indians, Harvey made 4 and 35. The next week, he made 89 in the primary innings against South Australia however overseen just three in the second innings as the Victorians fallen to be full scale for 182 and lost by nine wickets.
