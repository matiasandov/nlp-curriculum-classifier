The Daily Show 

The Daily Show is an American late-night talk and news parody TV program. It affectation every Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Portraying itself as a phony news program, "The Daily Show" draws its parody and parody from late news stories, political figures, media associations, and regularly utilizes self-referential cleverness too. 

The half-hour-long show debuted on July 21, 1996, and was first facilitated by Craig Kilborn until December 17, 1998. Jon Stewart at that point took over as the host from January 11, 1999, until August 6, 2015, making the show all the more emphatically centered around political parody and news parody, conversely with the popular culture center amid Kilborn's residency. Stewart was prevailing by Trevor Noah, whose residency debuted on September 28, 2015. Under various hosts, the show has been formally known as "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" from 1999 until 2015, and "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah" since 2015. "The Daily Show" is the longest-running project on Comedy Central (tallying every one of the three residencies), and has won 24 Primetime Emmy Awards. 

The program is prevalent among youthful crowds. The Pew Research Center recommended in 2010 that 74% of customary watchers were somewhere in the range of 18 and 49, and that 10% of the gathering of people watched the show for its news features, 2% for top to bottom detailing, and 43% for amusement, contrasted and 64% who viewed CNN for the news features. 

Commentators chastised Stewart for not directing adequately hard-hitting interviews with his political visitors, some of whom he may have satirized in past fragments. Stewart and other "Day by day Show" authors reacted to such analysis by saying that they don't have any journalistic obligation and that as comics their solitary obligation is to give stimulation. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show "Crossfire" got this discussion, where he chastised the CNN creation and hosts for not directing educational and current meetings on a news arrange. 

Every scene starts with commentator Drew Birns declaring the date and the presentation, "From Comedy Central's World News Headquarters in New York, this is "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah"". Already, the presentation was "This is "The Daily Show," the most essential TV program, ever." The host at that point opens the show with a monolog drawing from current news stories and issues. Already, the show had partitioned its news analysis into segments known as "Features", "Different News", and "This Just In"; these titles were dropped from standard use on October 28, 2002, and were keep going utilized on March 6, 2003. A few scenes will start with a 1Ã¢ÂÂ3 moment introduction on a little story (or little arrangement of stories) before completely changing into the principle story of the night. 

The monolog fragment is frequently trailed by a portion highlighting a trade with a correspondentÃ¢ÂÂtypically presented as the show's "senior" pro in the subject at handÃ¢ÂÂeither at the stay work area with the host or revealing from a bogus area before a greenscreen indicating stock film. Their expressed subject matters differ contingent upon the news story that is being talked about, and can run from moderately broad, (for example, Senior Political Analyst) to ridiculously explicit, (for example, Senior Religious Registry Correspondent). The cast of journalists is very assorted, and numerous frequently snidely depict extraordinary generalizations of themselves to make jokes about a news story, for example, "Senior Latino Correspondent", "Senior Youth Correspondent" or "Senior Black Correspondent". They regularly present preposterous or cleverly misrepresented takes on recent developments against the host's straight man. 

While journalists expressed to report abroad are generally performing in-studio before a greenscreen foundation, on uncommon events, cast individuals have recorded pieces on area. For example, amid the seven day stretch of August 20, 2007, the show circulated a progression of portions called "Task Silent Thunder: The Daily Show in Iraq" in which reporter Rob Riggle detailed from Iraq. In August 2008, Riggle headed out to China for a progression of portions titled "Ransack Riggle: Chasing the Dragon", which concentrated on the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

Jason Jones made a trip to Iran toward the beginning of June 2009 to provide details regarding the Iranian races, and John Oliver made a trip to South Africa for the arrangement of portions "Into Africa" to investigate the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In March 2012, Oliver made a trip to Gabon, on the west African coast, to give an account of the Gabonese government's choice to give $2 million to UNESCO after the United States cut its financing for UNESCO prior that year. On July 19, 2016, Roy Wood Jr. detailed live from the Republican National Convention and discussed Donald Trump's African-American help. 

Journalist fragments include a pivoting supporting cast, and include the show's individuals making a trip to various areas to document comedic investigates current news stories and direct meetings with individuals identified with the highlighted issue. Themes have differed generally; amid the early long periods of the show they inclined toward character-driven human intrigue stories, for example, Bigfoot devotees. Since Stewart started facilitating in 1999, the focal point of the show has turned out to be increasingly political and the field pieces have come to all the more intently reflect current issues and discussions. Under Kilborn and the early long stretches of Stewart, most interviewees were either uninformed or not by any means mindful of the comedic idea of "The Daily Show". Be that as it may, as the show started to pick up popularityÃ¢ÂÂparticularly following its inclusion of the 2000 and 2004 presidential electionsÃ¢ÂÂmost of the subjects currently met know about the comedic component. 

A few portions have repeated occasionally all through various residencies, for example, "Back in Black" (fragments facilitated by comic Lewis Black) and "Your Moment of Zen". Since the 2003 attack of Iraq, a typical fragment of the show has been named "Wreckage O' Potamia", concentrating on the United States' arrangements in the Middle East, particularly Iraq. Races in the United States were a conspicuous concentration in the show's "Uncertainty" inclusion all through Stewart and Noah's time as host (the title "Hesitation" is a farce of NBC News' "Choice" fragment). Since 2000, under Stewart's residency, the show went making a course for record week-long specials from the urban areas facilitating the Democratic and Republican National Convention. For the 2006 U.S. midterm races, seven days of scenes was recorded in the challenged province of Ohio. The "Hesitation" and "Democalpyse" inclusion of the 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 races all finished in live Election Night specials. 

With Noah as host, one new repeating section has been "What the Actual Fact", with journalist Desi Lydic analyzing articulations made by political figures amid addresses or occasions. Under Noah, the continuation of "Democalypse" and "Hesitation" additionally occurred with live shows after the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention. Out of the blue, under Noah, the show additionally went live after every one of the three U.S. presidential discussions in 2016. 

In the show's third demonstration, the host leads a meeting with a big name visitor. Visitors originate from a wide scope of social sources, and incorporate performing artists, artists, creators, competitors, intellectuals, strategy specialists and political figures. Amid Stewart's residency, the show's visitors tended far from VIPs and more towards genuine creators and political intellectuals, just as numerous conspicuous chosen authorities. In the show's prior years it attempted to book prominent lawmakers. (In 1999, for a "Hesitation 2000" section, Steve Carell attempted to talk his way off Republican applicant John McCain's press flood transport and onto the Straight Talk Express). 

Anyway its ascent in prominence, especially following the show's inclusion of the 2000 and 2004 races, made Stewart as indicated by a "Moving Stone" (2006) article, "the hot goal for any individual who needs to sell books or appear to be hip, from presidential contender to military tyrants". "Newsweek" marked it "the coolest pit stop on TV". 

Conspicuous political visitors have included U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, previous Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, previous British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, previous Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, previous Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Bolivian President Evo Morales, Jordanian King Abdullah II, Estonian Prime Minister Taavi Roivas, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and previous Mexican President Vicente Fox. 

The show has played host to previous and current individuals from the Administration and Cabinet just as individuals from Congress. Various presidential hopefuls have showed up on the show amid their battles, including John McCain, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. 

In an end portion, there is a short segue to the end credits as the host presenting "Your Moment of Zen", an entertaining bit of video film without discourse that has been a piece of the show's wrap-up since the arrangement started in 1996. The fragment regularly identifies with a story shrouded before in the scene, yet sporadically is only a diverting or ludicrous clasp. Once in a while, the portion is utilized as a tribute to somebody who has kicked the bucket. 

Now and then, before the "Your Moment of Zen", this section is utilized for speedy advancements. The host may advance the demonstrate that pursues directly after their communicate, for example, advancing the show "@midnight". This time has likewise been utilized to advance movies, books or stand-up specials that are associated with the host. 

In October 2005, after "The Colbert Report" debut, another component (now and again alluded to as the hurl) was added to the end fragment in which Stewart would have a short trade with "our great companion, Stephen Colbert at "The Colbert Report"", which circulated following. The two would have a scripted comedic trade by means of split-screen from their separate sets. In 2007, the "hurl" was reduced to two times every week, and by 2009 was at one time seven days before step by step being eliminated. It was utilized on the 2014 mid-term race night and again just before the last scene of "The Colbert Report" on December 18, 2014, and returned upon the debut of "The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore". Stewart at that point routinely hurled to Wilmore toward the finish of his Monday night scenes. Under Noah, the "hurl" has been utilized for "The Opposition with Jordan Klepper". 

The host sits at his work area on the raised island arrange in the style of a customary news appear. The show migrated from its unique New York studio in late-1998 to NEP Studio 54 in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where it stayed until 2005, when the studio was asserted by "The Colbert Report". On July 11, 2005, the show debuted in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 eleventh Avenue, a couple of squares west of its previous area. 

The arrangement of the new studio was given a sleeker, progressively formal look, including a scenery of three substantial projection screens. The conventional visitors' lounge chair, which had been a piece of the set since the show's debut, was discarded for straightforward upstanding seats. The change was at first not generally welcomed, generating a reaction among certain fans and provoking a "Present to Back the Couch" battle. The crusade was referenced on ensuing shows by Stewart and upheld by "Every day Show" supporter Bob Wiltfong. The sofa was inevitably highlighted in a sweepstakes in which the champ got the love seat, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show, and a little entirety of cash. 

On April 9, 2007, the show appeared another set. The projection screens were patched up (with one huge screen behind Stewart, while the littler one behind the meeting subject continued as before), an expansive, worldwide guide straightforwardly behind Stewart, an increasingly open studio floor, and a J-molded work area bolstered toward one side by a globe. The introduction was additionally refreshed; the illustrations, show names, dates, and logos were altogether changed. 

On September 28, 2015, the show appeared another set close by the presentation of Trevor Noah's residency. As per Larry Hartman, Noah took a great deal of motivation from Stewart's set. A second in front of an audience 'gigantic tron' was included and the shades of the set were made lighter. The designs, introduction, signature music, lower thirds, logo, and so on were additionally all patched up. On July 19, 2016, the set and illustrations were given another change to reflect Democalypse 2016 and mean "The Daily Show's" RNC and DNC inclusion (which was taped in the shows' individual urban areas). The new transitory sets had a Washington topic, and was intended to demonstrate that Washington is "somewhat penniless" and needs "fix". In spite of the fact that the studio was returned to its previous self after the decision week in 2016, the progressions to the designs were kept. 

The show's authors start every day with a morning meeting where they audit material that scientists have assembled from real papers, the Associated Press, link news TV slots and sites, and examine feature material for the lead news fragment. For the duration of the morning they chip away at composing due date pieces motivated by late news, just as longer-term ventures. By noon, Noah Ã¢ÂÂ who depicts his job as that of the chief of a group Ã¢ÂÂ has started to survey feature jokes. The content is put together by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is a practice. An hour is left for revises before a 6 pm taping before a live studio group of onlookers. 

"The Daily Show" normally tapes four new scenes seven days, Monday through Thursday, forty-two weeks per year. The show is communicated at 11 PM Eastern/10 PM Central, when nearby TV slots demonstrate their news reports and about 30 minutes before most other late-night parody programs start to go broadcasting live. The program is rerun a few times the following day, including a 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM Central prime time communicate. 

"The Daily Show" was made by Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg and debuted on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, having been promoted as a swap for "Politically Incorrect" (a fruitful Comedy Central program that had moved to ABC before that year). Madeleine Smithberg was co-maker of "The Daily Show" just as the previous official maker. An alum of Binghamton University, she was an official maker of "Steve Harvey's Big Time" and an ability facilitator for "Late Night with David Letterman". 

Expecting to spoof traditional broadcasts, it highlighted a comedic monolog of the day's features from stay Craig Kilborn (an outstanding co-grapple of ESPN's "SportsCenter"), just as mockumentary style on-area reports, in-studio portions and discussions from ordinary journalists Winstead, Brian Unger, Beth Littleford, and A. Whitney Brown. 

Regular fragments included "This Day in Hasselhoff History" and "A weekend ago's Top-Grossing Films, Converted into Lira", in spoof of amusement news appears and their propensity to lead out to ads with random data, for example, VIP birthday celebrations. Another business lead-out highlighted Winstead's folks, on her replying mail, perusing that day's "Last Jeopardy!" question and answer. In each show, Kilborn would direct superstar interviews, finishing with a fragment called "Five Questions" in which the visitor was made to address a progression of inquiries that were regularly a mix of darken reality and emotional assessment. These are featured in a 1998 book titled "The Daily Show: Five Questions", which contains transcripts of Kilborn's best meetings. Every scene closed with a portion called "Your Moment of Zen" that indicated arbitrary video clasps of clever and at times bleak intrigue, for example, guests at a Chinese zoo bolstering infant chickens to the crocodiles. Initially the show was recorded without a studio gathering of people, including just the chuckling of its own off-camera staff individuals. A studio group of onlookers was fused into the show for its second season, and has stayed since. 

The show was significantly less politically centered than it later ended up under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert depicted as a nearby news feel and including more character-driven amusingness rather than news-driven silliness. Winstead reviews that when the show was first propelled there was consistent discussion in regards to what the show's center ought to be. While she needed a more news-driven center, the system was worried this would not engage watchers and pushed for "somewhat more of a half and half of amusement and governmental issues". The show was pummeled by certain commentators as being too cowardly, especially towards the meeting subjects of field pieces; an analysis recognized by a portion of the show's cast. Portraying his time as a reporter under Kilborn, Colbert says, "You needed to take your spirit off, put it on a wire holder, and abandon it in the storeroom before you jumped on the plane to complete one of these pieces." One analyst from "The New York Times" condemned the show for being excessively barbarous and for coming up short on a focal article vision or belief system, depicting it as "deprived of an ideological or aesthetic focus... bright however vacant." 

There were reports of behind the stage contact among Kilborn and a portion of the female staff, especially the show's co-maker Lizz Winstead. Winstead had not been engaged with the employing of Kilborn, and couldn't help contradicting him over what heading the show should take. "I went through eight months creating and staffing a show and looking for a tone with makers and scholars. Another person set up him. There will undoubtedly be issues. I saw the show as substance driven; he saw it as host-driven", she said. In a 1997 "Esquire" magazine talk with, Kilborn poked an explicitly express fun at Winstead. Funny TV reacted by suspending Kilborn without pay for multi week, and Winstead quit before long. 

In 1998, Kilborn left "The Daily Show" to supplant Tom Snyder on CBS's "The Late Show". He guaranteed the "Five Questions" talk with section as licensed innovation, refusing any future "Day by day Show" has from utilizing it in their meetings. Journalists Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown left the show in a matter of seconds before him, yet most of the show's group and composing staff remained on. Kilborn's last show as host disclosed on December 17, 1998, finishing a 386-scene residency. Reruns were appeared until Jon Stewart's introduction a month later. Kilborn showed up on Jon Stewart's last version of the "Every day Show" saying "I realized you were going to destroy this thing." 

Comic Jon Stewart took over as host of the show, which was retitled "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart", on January 11, 1999. Stewart had recently facilitated "Limited ability to focus Theater" on Comedy Central, two shows on MTV ("You Wrote It, You Watch It" and an eponymous television show), just as a syndicated late-night syndicated program, and had been cast in movies and TV. In taking over facilitating from Kilborn, Stewart at first held a great part of a similar staff and on-air ability, enabling numerous pieces to change absent much inconvenience, while different highlights like "God Stuff", with John Bloom displaying a collection of real clasps from different TV preachers, and "Reverse discharge", an in-studio banter between Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown, developed into the comparative bits of "This current Week in God" and Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell's "Even Stevphen". After the change, various new highlights were created. The completion section "Your Moment of Zen", already comprising of an arbitrary determination of diverting recordings, was differentiated to at times incorporate recaps or broadened forms of news cuts appeared in the show. The show's signature music, "Puppy on Fire" by Bob Mold, was re-recorded by They Might Be Giants not long after Stewart joined the show. 

Stewart served as host as well as an author and official maker of the arrangement. He reviews that he at first battled with the Kilborn remainder essayists to oversee the show and put his very own engraving on the show's voice, a battle that prompted the flight of some of the extra scholars. Instrumental in molding the voice of the show under Stewart was previous editorial manager of "The Onion" Ben Karlin who, alongside individual "Onion" donor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head essayist and was later elevated to official maker. Their involvement recorded as a hard copy for the sarcastic paper, which utilizes counterfeit stories to taunt genuine print news coverage and recent developments, would impact the comedic course of the show; Stewart reviews the procuring of Karlin as the time when things "[started] to come to fruition". Portraying his way to deal with the show, Karlin stated, "The primary concern, for me, is seeing pietism. Individuals who know better saying things that you realize they don't accept." 

Under Stewart and Karlin "The Daily Show" built up a notably extraordinary style, conveying a more keen political concentration to the silliness than the show recently displayed. At that point journalist Stephen Colbert reviews that Stewart explicitly requested that he have a political perspective, and to enable his enthusiasm for issues to bring through into his parody. Colbert says that though under Kilborn the attention was on "human intrigue y" pieces, with Stewart as host the show's substance turned out to be more "issues and news driven", especially after the start of the 2000 decision crusade with which the show managed in its "" inclusion. Stewart himself depicts the show's inclusion of the 2000 race describe as the time when the show discovered its publication voice. "That is the point at which I think we took advantage of the passionate edge of the news for us and found our publication balance," he says. Following the September eleventh assaults, "The Daily Show" went off the air for nine days. Upon its arrival, Stewart opened the show with a solemn monolog, that, as per Jeremy Gillick and Nonna Gorilovskaya, tended to both the craziness and significance of his job as a comic. Remarked Stewart: 

Gillick and Gorilovskaya point to the September 11 assaults and the start of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as the time when Jon Stewart developed as a confided in national figure. Robert Thompson, the executive of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, reviewed of this period, "When all the news folks were tread lightly, Jon was pounding those inquiries regarding WMDs." 

Amid Stewart's residency, the job of the reporter widened to envelop field portions as well as incessant in-studio trades. Under Kilborn, Colbert says that his work as a reporter at first included "character driven [field] piecesÃ¢ÂÂlike, you know, folks who have faith in Bigfoot." However, as the focal point of the show has turned out to be more news-driven, reporters have progressively been utilized in studio pieces, either as specialists examining issues at the grapple work area or as field writers revealing from false areas before a green screen. Colbert says that this change has enabled journalists to be increasingly required with the show, as it has allowed them to work all the more intimately with the host and authors. 

The show's 2000 and 2004 race inclusion, joined with another ironical edge, shot Stewart and "The Daily Show" higher than ever of fame and basic regard. Since Stewart moved toward becoming host, the show has won 23 Primetime Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards, and its evaluations consistently expanded. In 2003, the show was averaging almost a million watchers, an expansion of about triple since the show's beginning as Comedy Central ended up accessible in more family units. By September 2008, the show arrived at the midpoint of almost two million watchers for every night. Congressperson Barack Obama's meeting on October 29, 2008, pulled in 3.6Ã¢Â million watchers. 

The move towards more noteworthy inclusion in political issues and the expanding notoriety of the show in certain key socioeconomics have prompted examinations of where the perspectives on the show fit in the political range. Adam Clymer, among numerous others, has contended that "The Daily Show" is more condemning of Republicans than Democrats. Stewart, who casted a ballot Democratic in the 2004 presidential race, recognized that the show has an increasingly liberal perspective, however that it isn't "a liberal association" with a political plan and its obligation as a matter of first importance is to be clever. He recognizes that the show isn't really an "equivalent open door guilty party", disclosing that Republicans would in general give more comedic grain since "I think we consider those with power and impact targets and those without it, not." In a meeting in 2005, when asked how he reacted to faultfinders guaranteeing that "The Daily Show" is excessively liberal, Stephen Colbert, likewise a self-declared Democrat, said in a meeting amid the Bush Administration, when the Republicans held a lion's share in the House and Senate: "We are liberal, yet Jon's aware of the Republican visitors, and, tune in, if nonconformists were in power it is simpler to assault them, yet Republicans have the official, authoritative and legal branches, so ridiculing Democrats resembles kicking a kid, so it's simply not justified, despite any potential benefits." 

Stewart is incredulous of Democratic lawmakers for being powerless, hesitant, or ineffectual. He said in a meeting with Larry King, preceding the 2006 decisions, "I sincerely don't feel that [the Democrats] have an effect. They have forty-nine percent of the vote and three percent of the power. At one point you go, 'Folks, get your amusement.'" He has focused on them for neglecting to adequately remain on certain issues, for example, the war in Iraq, depicting them as "inept" and "incapable... to find their butts, notwithstanding when given two hands and an extraordinary ass map." 

Karlin, at that point the show's official maker, said in a 2004 meeting that while there is an aggregate reasonableness among the staff which, "when sifted through Jon and the reporters, feels uniform," the foremost objective of the show is satire. "On the off chance that you have a truly amusing joke in help of the idea that gay individuals are an attack against God, we'll put that mother lover on!" 

On September 15, 2003, Senator John Edwards turned into the primary contender to declare that they were running for president on the show, causing Jon Stewart to facetiously illuminate him that their show was "phony" and he may need to reannounce somewhere else. On November 17, 2009, Vice President Joe Biden showed up on the show, making him the principal sitting VP to do as such. On October 27, 2010, President Barack Obama turned into the main sitting U.S. president to be met on the show, wherein Obama remarked he "adored" the show. Obama disagreed with Stewart's proposal that his social insurance program was "tentative." 

After the United States Senate neglected to pass and the media neglected to cover the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would give wellbeing checking and money related guide to wiped out people on call of the September 11 assaults, Stewart devoted the whole December 16, 2010, communicate to the issue. Amid the following week, a resuscitated adaptation of the bill increased new life, with the capability of being passed before the winter break. Stewart was lauded by the two government officials and influenced people on call for the bill's section. As per Syracuse University educator of TV, radio and film Robert J. Thompson, "Without him, it's impossible it would've passed. I don't think Brian Williams, Katie Couric or Diane Sawyer would've been permitted to do this." 

Because of the 2007Ã¢ÂÂ08 Writers Guild of America strike, the show went on rest on November 5, 2007. Despite the fact that the strike proceeded until February 2008, the show came back to air on January 7, 2008, without its staff of scholars. In solidarity with the authors, the show was alluded to as A Daily Show with Jon Stewart as opposed to "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart," until the finish of the strike. As an individual from the Writers Guild of America, Stewart was banished from composing any material for the demonstrate to himself which he or his authors would commonly compose. Therefore, Stewart and the journalists to a great extent advertisement libbed the show around arranged points. 

With an end goal to fill time while keeping to the strike-related confinements, the show broadcast or re-circulated some recently recorded portions, and Stewart occupied with a quickly repeating counterfeit fight with individual late-night has Stephen Colbert and Conan O'Brien. The strike authoritatively finished on February 12, 2008, with the show's journalists coming back to work the next day, so, all in all the title of "The Daily Show" was reestablished. 

Beginning in June 2013 Jon Stewart took a twelve-week break to coordinate "Rosewater", a dramatization about a writer imprisoned by Iran for four months. John Oliver supplanted Stewart at the stay work area for two months, to be trailed by one month of reruns. Oliver got positive surveys for his facilitating, prompting his takeoff from the show in December 2013 for his own show "A week ago Tonight with John Oliver", which appeared April 27, 2014, on HBO. 

On February 10, 2015, Stewart reported that he would leave the show later in the year. Funny TV demonstrated in an explanation that "The Daily Show" would proceed without Stewart, saying it would "suffer for a considerable length of time to come". 

On June 25, 2015, Comedy Central reported that to pave the way to Stewart's last scene, it would hold "Your Month of Zen"Ã¢ÂÂan online long distance race spilling each scene of Stewart's residency from June 26 to August 6, 2015. 

On August 5, 2015, Stewart's long-term companion of 30 years entertainer Louis C.K. was chosen to be the last visitor before the last Daily Show scene with Stewart helming the show. C.K. clowned that he was there "speaking to parody to state great job". 

On August 6, 2015, Stewart's last scene circulated as 60 minutes in length exceptional in three fragments. The principal highlighted a get-together of a larger part of the reporters and benefactors from all through the show's history just as a pre-recorded "hostile to tribute" (deriding Stewart) from different continuous visitors and "companions" of the show. This included Bill O'Reilly, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie, John Kerry, and Chuck Schumer. 

The second fragment highlighted a pre-recorded voyage through the Daily Show creation office and studio presenting the majority of the show's staff and group. The last fragment included a short goodbye discourse from Stewart pursued by the last "Snapshot of Zen" (being 'his own' snapshot of zen): an execution of "Place where there is Hope and Dreams" and "Destined to Run" by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. 

On March 30, 2015, it was declared that Trevor Noah would supplant Stewart as host of "The Daily Show". Trevor Noah's first show was on September 28, 2015, with comic Kevin Hart as his first visitor. Noah's debut scene was simulcast by Viacom on Comedy Central, Nick at Nite, Spike, MTV, MTV2, mtvU, VH1, VH1 Classic, BET, Centric, CMT, TV Land and Logo TV. 

On September 14, 2017, it was reported that Comedy Central had broadened Trevor Noah's agreement as host of "The Daily Show" for a long time, through 2022. 

Notwithstanding changes in the tone of the show, Noah has likewise actualized elaborate changes to the show, with a refreshed set, new illustrations and his monolog once in a while occurring while at the same time remaining before a screen instead of sitting at the work area. Trevor likewise expanded the utilization of increasingly millennial-based references, pantomimes and portrayals for his satire on the show, because of his more youthful statistic and his capacity to talk in various accents and eight dialects. 

The presentation of "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah" brought along three new journalists: Roy Wood Jr., Desi Lydic and Ronny Chieng. 

Extra reporters were included 2017. Michael Kosta turned into the Senior Constitutional Correspondent and Senior American Correspondent on July 11, 2017. DulcÄÅ¡ Sloan turned into the Senior Fashion Correspondent on September 7, 2017. 

In January 2016, "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah" began to utilize a changed rendition of the show's past topic, remixed by Timbaland and King Logan. 

Trevor Noah additionally abstained from speaking a lot about Fox News, as Stewart was recently known for. ""The Daily Show" depended on a developing 24 hour news cycle, thatÃ¢ÂÂs all that it was, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what roused "The Daily Show". Presently you take a gander at news and itÃ¢ÂÂs changed. ItÃ¢ÂÂs never again predicated around 24 hour news. There are such huge numbers of various decisions. Half of it is online at this point. Presently youÃ¢ÂÂve got the Gawkers, the Buzzfeeds. The manner in which individuals are drawing their news is soundbites and features and misleading content connections has made a huge difference. The greatest test will be an energizing one I'm certain is the way are we going to unite the majority of that taking a gander at it from a greater focal point instead of simply following one sourceÃ¢ÂÂwhich was verifiably Fox News," Noah said at a public interview before the show's presentation.

The show has included various understood comics all through its run and is outstanding for boosting the vocations of a few of these.

As the lines between satire show and news show have obscured, Jon Stewart has gone under weight in certain circles to participate in increasingly genuine reporting. Exhaust Carlson and "Day by day Show" co-maker Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for condemning government officials and newspeople in his performance fragments and after that, in meetings with similar individuals, seldom berating them eye to eye. In 2004, Winstead communicated a craving for Stewart to make more enthusiastically ironical inquiries, saying, "When you are meeting a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, in the event that you give them a pass, at that point you become what you are ridiculing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couchÃ¢ÂÂto simply given him a chance to be a war criminal sitting on your love seat implies you are regarding some sort of limit." She has contended that "The Daily Show" achievement and access to the young vote ought to enable Stewart to press political visitors harder without expecting that they won't come back to the show.

At the point when co-have Carlson contended that Stewart himself had not asked John Kerry significant inquiries when Kerry showed up on "The Daily Show", Stewart countered that it was not his business to give hard-hitting interviews and that a "phony news" parody program ought not be held to indistinguishable models from genuine news-casting. "No doubt about it!" Stewart stated, "The demonstrate that leads into me is manikins making wrench telephone calls! What's up with you?" Media commentator Dan Kennedy says that Stewart put on a show of being insincere in this trade since "you can't talk with Bill Clinton, Richard Clarke, Bill O'Reilly, Bob Dole, and so on., and so forth., and still say you're only an entertainer." 

A recent report into the impact of "The Daily Show" on watchers' dispositions found that members had an increasingly negative supposition of both President Bush and afterward Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Members likewise communicated increasingly critical perspectives on the appointive framework and news media.
