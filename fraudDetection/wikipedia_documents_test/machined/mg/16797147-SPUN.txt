New York State Route 424 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 424 (NYÃÂ 424) was an eastÃ¢ÂÂwest state thruway in northern Chautauqua County, New York, in the United States. The course started at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 380 (presently County RouteÃ¢Â 380 or CRÃÂ 380) in the town of Stockton and finished at an intersection with NYÃÂ 60 in the town of Cassadaga. NYÃÂ 424 was doled out as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state expressways in New York and expelled from the state roadway framework in 1980 as a feature of a parkway upkeep swap between the province of New York and Chautauqua County. The course's previous arrangement is currently part of CRÃÂ 58. 

NYÃÂ 424 started at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 380 in the town of Stockton. The course traveled upper east, going by backwoods and homes as it rose Stockton Hill. Here, it crossed with Nelson Hill Road, a short backup course of action of NYÃÂ 424. Subsequent to achieving the highest point of the slope, NYÃÂ 424 ended up known as Stockton Hill Road and experienced fields on its way to the town of Cassadaga. Once in as far as possible, the thruway crossed Putnam Road (CRÃÂ 71) in a territory of Cassadaga known as Burnhams. NYÃÂ 424 proceeded into the core of the town, going by homes and the southern end of Lower Lake before reaching an end at a convergence with NYÃÂ 60. 

NYÃÂ 424 was alloted as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state interstates in New York. It went unaltered until AprilÃ¢Â 1, 1980, when proprietorship and support of the course was exchanged from the province of New York to Chautauqua County as a feature of an expressway upkeep swap between the two dimensions of government. Different courses given to the province were the part of NYÃÂ 380 among NYÃÂ 424 and U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 20 (USÃÂ 20), the sum of NYÃÂ 428, and two reference courses in Dunkirk and Fredonia. Consequently, the state expected control of NYÃÂ 394 somewhere in the range of NYÃÂ 5 and USÃÂ 20, USÃÂ 62 from NYÃÂ 394 to NYÃÂ 60, and Forest Avenue south of Jamestown. The NYÃÂ 424 assignment was authoritatively expelled on AugustÃ¢Â 7, 1980, and its previous directing is presently part of CRÃÂ 58, which was stretched out over the length of the state parkway.
