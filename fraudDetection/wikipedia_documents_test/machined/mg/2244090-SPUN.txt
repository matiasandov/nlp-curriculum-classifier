New York State Route 104 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 104 (NYÃÂ 104) is a long eastÃ¢ÂÂwest state thruway in Upstate New York in the United States. It traverses six provinces and enters the region of four citiesÃ¢ÂÂNiagara Falls, Lockport, Rochester, and OswegoÃ¢ÂÂas it pursues a directing to a great extent parallel toward the southern shoreline of Lake Ontario, along an edge of the old shoreline of Glacial Lake Iroquois. The western end of NYÃÂ 104 is a convergence with NYÃÂ 384 in Niagara Falls, Niagara County, while its eastern end is an intersection with NYÃÂ 13 in the town of Williamstown, Oswego County. The bit of NYÃÂ 104 among Rochester and the town of Webster east of the city is a constrained access thruway known as the Keeler Street Expressway west of NYÃÂ 590 and the IrondequoitÃ¢ÂÂWayne County Expressway east of NYÃÂ 590; from Williamson to Oswego, NYÃÂ 104 is a too two interstate. 

Most of Ridge Road and present day NYÃÂ 104 from the town of Red Creek to the town of Mexico were initially assigned as a feature of RouteÃ¢Â 30, an unsigned authoritative course, right off the bat in the twentieth century. All of Ridge Road and its continuation through Oswego to the village of Maple View picked up a marked assignment by 1926 and turned out to be a piece of U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 104 (USÃÂ 104), a United States Numbered Highway reaching out from Niagara Falls to Maple View, . USÃÂ 104, which never associated with USÃÂ 4, its inferred parent course, was redesignated as NYÃÂ 104 . As a feature of the redesignation, NYÃÂ 104 was stretched out east to NYÃÂ 13 in Williamstown over what had been New York State RouteÃ¢Â 126. 

The 104 assignment, regardless of whether it be USÃÂ 104 or NYÃÂ 104, has moved from surface roads to freeways and excessively twos, especially from Rochester east to Oswego. The principal such realignment happened during the 1940s in Wayne County and was finished by the realignment of NYÃÂ 104 onto the IrondequoitÃ¢ÂÂWayne County Expressway close Webster during the 1980s. 

NYÃÂ 104 starts at the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls. The Seaway Trail crosses NYÃÂ 384 and pursues NYÃÂ 104 north on First Street for one square to the Niagara Scenic Parkway, where the byway and NYÃÂ 104 veer onto Main Street. NYÃÂ 104 finishes Main Street the city's to a great extent business west side and crosses the northern or eastern end for USÃÂ 62 (Ferry Avenue and Walnut Avenue) and USÃÂ 62 Business (Pine Avenue). North of USÃÂ 62 Business, the territory turns out to be increasingly private as NYÃÂ 104 meets NYÃÂ 182 southeast of the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. Toward the north, NYÃÂ 104's name changes to Lewiston Road as it passes the south grounds of Niagara University. Close to the northern degree of the grounds, NYÃÂ 104 meets the western end of NYÃÂ 31, here named College Avenue. At as far as possible, NYÃÂ 104 meets the northbound Robert Moses State Parkway by method for a half-exchange. The bit of NYÃÂ 104 between Third Street and the Lewiston town line is kept up by the city of Niagara Falls, and is the main piece of NYÃÂ 104 that isn't kept up by the New York State Department of Transportation. 

Presently in the town of Lewiston, NYÃÂ 104 comes extremely close to the Niagara River chasm and starts to keep running along its eastern edge. NYÃÂ 104 meets the northernmost purpose of NYÃÂ 61 at the northern grounds of Niagara University. Past NYÃÂ 61, the course goes by the Niagara Power Visitors Center and over the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant. On the contrary side of the plant, NYÃÂ 104 associates with InterstateÃ¢Â 190 (I-190) at exitÃ¢Â 25 by means of Upper Mountain Road and goes under the eastern way to deal with the LewistonÃ¢ÂÂQueenston Bridge, which joins I-190 with Ontario's HighwayÃ¢Â 405. 

Past I-190, NYÃÂ 104 starts to veer off from the Niagara River. It heads through a little neighborhood arranged between the Moses Parkway and NYÃÂ 104 and crosses the northern end of NYÃÂ 265. North of this intersection, NYÃÂ 104 bends upper east to dive the Niagara Escarpment. As it heads descending in height, it converges the western end of NYÃÂ 18 by method for a trade. As a major aspect of a similar exit, NYÃÂ 104 meets the expressway once again just as the southern end of NYÃÂ 18F close to the town of Lewiston. Here, the Seaway Trail leaves NYÃÂ 104 to pursue NYÃÂ 18F. East of the exit, NYÃÂ 104 crosses NYÃÂ 18 again by method for another trade. 

East of Lewiston town, NYÃÂ 104 finishes Ridge Road an inadequately populated region of Niagara County. Quite a bit of this bit of NYÃÂ 104 is verged on its southern end by the Tuscarora Indian Reservation. At the Lewiston villa of Dickersonville, the degrees of the booking head south, and improvement along NYÃÂ 104 increments marginally. NYÃÂ 104 meets the northern end of NYÃÂ 429 at the LewistonÃ¢ÂÂCambria town line and traverses NYÃÂ 425 at Streeters Corners. Only east of this area is a convergence with NYÃÂ 93 in the network of Molyneaux Corners. The two courses structure a simultaneousness east to Warrens Corners, a village on the CambriaÃ¢ÂÂLockport town line, where NYÃÂ 93 swings south to serve the city of Lockport. 

NYÃÂ 104 travels upper east through the extraordinary northwest corner of the town of Lockport to the town line, where it swings eastbound to straddle the limit between the towns of Lockport and Newfane. As it approaches the villa of Wrights Corners, the advancement along NYÃÂ 104 increments significantly with the dimension topping at the intersection of NYÃÂ 104 and NYÃÂ 78. The two courses join for generally into the town of Newfane before part north of the village. Edge Road proceeds with upper east through a private region, which offers approach to open fields yet again at Ridgewood. NYÃÂ 104 turns east here, going through the town of Hartland and converging the southern end of NYÃÂ 148 and the northern end of NYÃÂ 271. The course crosses into Orleans County at an intersection with the southern end of NYÃÂ 269, which straddles the province line. 

The course travels upper east through the town of Ridgeway to the village of a similar name, where NYÃÂ 104 meets NYÃÂ 63. NYÃÂ 63 joins NYÃÂ 104 east along Ridge Road for about before proceeding with north toward Lake Ontario. NYÃÂ 104, in the mean time, proceeds through the rustic towns of Ridgeway and Gaines to an intersection with NYÃÂ 279 north of Albion. Not far toward the east, NYÃÂ 104 converges NYÃÂ 98, the essential northÃ¢ÂÂsouth interstate through Albion, in the village of Childs. Simply past the convergence on the north side of the street are two of the three cobblestone structures of the Cobblestone Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. 

More remote east, Ridge Road enters the town of Murray, where it meets the northern end of NYÃÂ 387 and crosses NYÃÂ 237 in the villa of Murray. The two courses join for simply under a mile (1.6Ã¢Â km) before NYÃÂ 237 splits away toward the south toward Holley. NYÃÂ 104 exits Orleans County later in a similar manner as it entered: by converging a state expressway. Subsequent to meeting the southern end of NYÃÂ 272, NYÃÂ 104 crosses into Monroe County and turns out to be West Ridge Road as it heads through the town of Clarkson. In the thickly populated village of Clarkson Corners, NYÃÂ 104 meets NYÃÂ 19. The open fields return east of the village, and to a great extent encompass Ridge Road as NYÃÂ 104 converges NYÃÂ 260. NYÃÂ 104 heads forward into Parma, where it broadens to four paths and has an intersection with NYÃÂ 259 in Parma Corners. 

East of Parma Corners, advancement on NYÃÂ 104 consistently increments as it makes a beeline for the town of Greece. By the ParmaÃ¢ÂÂGreece town line, where NYÃÂ 104 meets the southern end of NYÃÂ 261, Ridge Road is fixed with business properties of fluctuating size. Proceeding with east, NYÃÂ 104 meets the northern end of NYÃÂ 386. Here, NY 104 augments to a six-path isolated expressway. Somewhere in the range of NYÃÂ 386 and NYÃÂ 390 exitÃ¢Â 24, NYÃÂ 104 goes by a few expansive shopping centers, the biggest of which is The Mall at Greece Ridge at the crossing point of NYÃÂ 104 and Long Pond Road. At NYÃÂ 390, NYÃÂ 104 keeps on being a six-path separated interstate as it makes a beeline for Rochester. It enters as far as possible after gathering Mount Read Boulevard at a trade. 

In Rochester, NYÃÂ 104 goes through a zone known as Kodak Park, the substantial mechanical complex possessed by Eastman Kodak that involves a whole neighborhood. Amidst the complex, NYÃÂ 104 crosses the Rochester and Southern Railroad and the CSX Transportation-claimed Charlotte Running Track and meets the eastern end of NYÃÂ 18. Proceeding with east, NYÃÂ 104 crosses the Genesee River gorge on the Veterans Memorial Bridge. On the contrary bank, it loses the name West Ridge Road and turns into a restricted access thruway known as the Keeler Street Expressway. 

North of the principal exit with St. Paul Street, Ridge Road reemerges as East Ridge Road, which parallels the turnpike toward the north. NYÃÂ 104 proceeds through Rochester and Irondequoit, interfacing with North Clinton Avenue, Seneca Avenue, Hudson Avenue, Carter Street, Portland Avenue, North Goodman Street and Culver Road by method for exchanges. Between the Goodman Street and Culver Road exits, NYÃÂ 104 passes the previous Medley Center. East of Culver, NYÃÂ 104 experiences NYÃÂ 590 and interfaces with NYÃÂ 590 southbound by method for an exchange. East Ridge Road goes through the center of this exchange, in spite of the fact that there are no associations among Ridge and NYÃÂ 104. There is likewise no entrance from NYÃÂ 104 eastward to NYÃÂ 590 northbound; eastward traffic must take Culver Road so as to go north toward Sea Breeze. Only east of the NYÃÂ 590 trade, NYÃÂ 104 turns into the IrondequoitÃ¢ÂÂWayne County Expressway and crosses the Irondequoit Bay by method for the Irondequoit Bay Bridge. A frontage road between NYÃÂ 104 only west of the extension and NYÃÂ 590 at Titus Avenue was once arranged. In spite of the fact that passageway and off-ramps were worked for the association along NYÃÂ 104, the remainder of the connection was never constructed, leaving no entrance from NYÃÂ 104 westward to NYÃÂ 590 northbound and from NYÃÂ 590 southbound to NYÃÂ 104 eastward. 

On the opposite side of the scaffold in the town of Webster, NYÃÂ 104 has exits prompting Bay Road, Five Mile Line Road, Hard Road, and Holt Road preceding entering the town of Webster. Inside the town, NYÃÂ 104 meets NYÃÂ 250 (North Avenue) and Phillips Road by method for trades before leaving the town. The turnpike freely parallels the southern edge of the essential Xerox grounds to an exit with Salt Road, where it downsizes to a separated roadway as it proceeds with east to Basket Road and the MonroeÃ¢ÂÂWayne region line, halfway delimited by NYÃÂ 404. 

As Ridge Road pursues toward the south, NYÃÂ 104 proceeds with east through Ontario, where it meets the northern end of NYÃÂ 350 in Ontario Center. The four-path isolated roadway proceeds with east to Williamson, where the middle isolating the two bearings of NYÃÂ 104 arrives at an end west of the village of Williamson. In the focal point of the villa, NYÃÂ 104 meets the northern end of NYÃÂ 21. NYÃÂ 104 river to two paths east of Williamson as improvement along the course decreases again, offering approach to open fields and thick timberlands. 

Close to the focal point of the province in the town of Sodus, NYÃÂ 104 fills in as the northern end of NYÃÂ 88 northwest of the town of Sodus. While NYÃÂ 88 travels east into the town, NYÃÂ 104 sidesteps Sodus toward the north. East of the town, Ridge Road and NYÃÂ 104 cross as Ridge Road flips toward the north side of NYÃÂ 104. The two parkways pursue parallel routings southeast toward Alton, where NYÃÂ 104 converges NYÃÂ 14. East of Alton, the hole between the two extends as Ridge Road veers north to get to Sodus Bay. NYÃÂ 104, then, pursues an almost straight steering into the town of Huron, where it converges the northern end of NYÃÂ 414. 

NYÃÂ 104 proceeds on the eastbound directing to the region of the town of Wolcott, where it interfaces with the northern end of NYÃÂ 89 by means of a half-jewel exchange south of the town. Upper east of this area in the town of Wolcott, Ridge Road converges NYÃÂ 104 by and by, coming back toward the south side of the course. The two streets pursue parallel routings yet again to an intersection south of Red Creek. At this country convergence, NYÃÂ 104 goes about as the southern and northern (western) end of both NYÃÂ 104A and NYÃÂ 370, separately, both possessing an augmentation of Ridge Road. Only east of the convergence is the WayneÃ¢ÂÂCayuga area line. Just of the course are arranged in Cayuga County, and the main intersection of note inside the province is with NYÃÂ 38, which it meets in the Sterling village of Martville. East of the intersection, NYÃÂ 104 swings strongly toward the upper east and enters Oswego County. 

The course proceeds with upper east through the town of Hannibal to the town of a similar name. Rather than entering the network, NYÃÂ 104 sidesteps it toward the east. It crosses NYÃÂ 3 east of Hannibal and heads north toward Lake Ontario. In the town of Oswego, NYÃÂ 104 meets the northern end of NYÃÂ 104A and expect its northeasterly directing. It is here that the Seaway Trail rejoins NYÃÂ 104. NYÃÂ 104 heads along the Lake Ontario shoreline to the lake-side city of Oswego, the principal area with huge improvement along the course since Williamson. The course converges Sweet Road, a connector prompting the grounds of SUNY Oswego, only west of as far as possible. 

NYÃÂ 104 enters the city as the two-laned West Seneca Street. At Baylis Street, the street enlarges to four paths isolated by a middle. After seven squares, NYÃÂ 104 veers onto West Bridge Street, a four-path road with no middle. NYÃÂ 104 proceeds with Bridge Street into downtown, where it crosses the northern end of NYÃÂ 48 on the west bank of the Oswego River and the northern end of NYÃÂ 481 on the east bank. As NYÃÂ 104 heads through eastern Oswego, it isolates from East Bridge Street and bends east to pursue an all the more inland directing. The course returns to two paths as it leaves as far as possible. 

The abnormal state of improvement along NYÃÂ 104 proceeds to the Scriba villa of a similar name, where it starts to turn out to be increasingly sporadic and offer approach to fields and thick woods. NYÃÂ 104 travels upper east to New Haven and the western end of NYÃÂ 104B. While NYÃÂ 104B travels upper east toward the lake shore as a major aspect of the Seaway Trail, NYÃÂ 104 slices southeast to serve the town of Mexico. In the town focus, NYÃÂ 104 quickly covers NYÃÂ 3 and converges the western end of NYÃÂ 69. The course proceeds due east through the rustic town of Mexico to the little villa of Maple View, revolved around the intersection somewhere in the range of NYÃÂ 104 and USÃÂ 11. Simply outside the villa, NYÃÂ 104 meets I-81 at exitÃ¢Â 34. Past I-81, NYÃÂ 104 travels east and southeast for nine miles (14Ã¢Â km) through the dominatingly country towns of Albion and Williamstown to its eastern end at an intersection with NYÃÂ 13. 

In 1908, the New York State Legislature built up RouteÃ¢Â 30, an unsigned administrative course reaching out from Niagara Falls, Niagara County in the southwest to Rouses Point, Clinton County, in the upper east. From Rochester to Red Creek, RouteÃ¢Â 30 was appointed to Ridge Road. Between Red Creek and the village of Union Square (presently Maple View) in the town of Mexico, it included a large portion of current NYÃÂ 104. In the meantime, the roadway close by the Niagara River between Ridge Road in Lewiston and Pine Avenue in downtown Niagara Falls was assigned, however not marked, as a major aspect of RouteÃ¢Â 18. By 1914, RouteÃ¢Â 30 was revised to likewise incorporate the area of Ridge Road from Porter (present day NYÃÂ 429) to Ridgeway (NYÃÂ 63). In 1914, another sectionÃ¢ÂÂfrom Ridgeway to the OrleansÃ¢ÂÂMonroe district lineÃ¢ÂÂwas additionally incorporated into RouteÃ¢Â 30's definition as a goad course. The goad course turned out to be a piece of RouteÃ¢Â 30 on March 1, 1921, when the mainline course was realigned to pursue Ridge Road among Ridgeway and Rochester. 

At the point when the main arrangement of posted courses in New York were allocated in 1924, the portions of RouteÃ¢Â 30 from Rochester to Red Creek and from Oswego to Maple View turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 3. Between Red Creek and Oswego, NYÃÂ 3 was directed on what is presently NYÃÂ 104A. More remote west, the bit of RouteÃ¢Â 18 from Niagara Falls to Lewiston was incorporated as a major aspect of NYÃÂ 34. By 1926, all of administrative RouteÃ¢Â 30 west of Rochester was assigned as a major aspect of NYÃÂ 31. In the late 1920s, be that as it may, NYÃÂ 31 was realigned to pursue Ridge Road west from Porter to Lewiston. In the 1930 renumbering of state roadways in New York, NYÃÂ 34 turned out to be a piece of an all-inclusive NYÃÂ 18 while NYÃÂ 3E was doled out to the segment of previous authoritative RouteÃ¢Â 30 between Red Creek and Oswego. NYÃÂ 3E was renumbered to NYÃÂ 3F . 

USÃÂ 104 was appointed crosswise over Upstate New York in April 1935, stretching out from Niagara Falls to Maple View by means of Lewiston, Rochester, and Oswego. It covered NYÃÂ 18 from Niagara Falls to Lewiston and supplanted NYÃÂ 3 and NYÃÂ 31 from Lewiston to Maple View (with the exception of from Red Creek to Oswego, where USÃÂ 104 pursued NYÃÂ 3F). Subsequently, NYÃÂ 31 was moved south onto the greater part of its cutting edge arrangement while NYÃÂ 3 was rerouted south of Watertown to pursue what had been NYÃÂ 3D. In spite of the fact that USÃÂ 104 was actually a kid course of USÃÂ 4, it didn't associate with USÃÂ 4. A roadway broadening eastbound from USÃÂ 11 and USÃÂ 104 at Maple View to NYÃÂ 13 in Williamstown was assigned as NYÃÂ 126 . 

When it was first appointed, USÃÂ 104 plunged south to serve downtown Rochester as opposed to bypassing it toward the north. USÃÂ 104 left Ridge Road at Lake Avenue and pursued Lake Avenue and State Street south to Main Street in downtown. It pursued Main Street and Winton Road to Empire Boulevard, where it swung east to rejoin Ridge Road in Webster. It was rerouted to proceed with east on Ridge Road over the Veterans Memorial Bridge and through Irondequoit to Culver Road. USÃÂ 104 turned here, after Culver Road south to Empire Boulevard and the last east to Winton Road, where it reconnected to its unique steering through the city. The realignment made a noteworthy cover with NYÃÂ 18, which joined USÃÂ 104 in the region of Kodak Park and isolated at Culver Road, where it traveled north. 

Work started during the 1940s on new overly two arrangements for USÃÂ 104 in Wayne, Cayuga, and Oswego districts. The new expressway was based on a directing parallel to that of Ridge Road and filled in as a detour of the networks along Ridge Road. The main segment of the excessively two, reaching out from the MonroeÃ¢ÂÂWayne province line at Union Hill to west of Sodus, was worked in the mid-1940s and finished by 1947. An expansion of the thruway around Sodus to NYÃÂ 414 in Huron was developed in the mid-1960s and opened by 1968. In the middle of the finish of the too two and Ridge Road, USÃÂ 104 was directed on Lake Bluff Road. The rest of the overly two among Huron and Red Creek was done by 1974. East of the excessively two, a detour was built around the town of Hannibal amid the mid 1960s and opened to traffic by 1964. 

Comparable change ventures were additionally led somewhere else. In Irondequoit, the bit of the Sea Breeze Expressway (presently NYÃÂ 590) from Empire Boulevard to Culver Road opened in the late 1950s. USÃÂ 104 and NYÃÂ 18 were broadened eastbound along East Ridge Road to meet the interstate at what is currently exitÃ¢Â 11. The two assignments entered the expressway; in any case, NYÃÂ 18 pursued the roadway north to Culver Road while USÃÂ 104 advanced south to Empire Boulevard, where it rejoined its previous surface arrangement towards Webster. The of Empire Boulevard between the Rochester city line and the Sea Breeze Expressway remains state-kept up right up 'til the present time as NYÃÂ 941B, an unsigned reference course. 

In the mid-1960s, development started on the Keeler Street Expressway, a restricted access thruway stretching out crosswise over Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the Sea Breeze Expressway. The main segment from North Goodman Street to the Sea Breeze Expressway was finished by 1968 while the rest of in late 1969. The name of the turnpike was gotten from Keeler Street, a little private road that initially associated with East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street by method for a traffic hover on the east bank of the Genesee River. The road was moved toward an impasse road because of the turnpike's development. USÃÂ 104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the turnpike, which stays known, though rarely, as the Keeler Street Expressway right up 'til today. NYÃÂ 18 stayed on East Ridge Road, be that as it may, decreasing the cover somewhere in the range of USÃÂ 104 and NYÃÂ 18 to simply the bit on the Veterans Bridge. NYÃÂ 18 was truncated to its current eastern end , dispensing with the cover altogether. 

The main portion of an eastbound expansion of the Keeler Street Expressway, named the IrondequoitÃ¢ÂÂWayne County Expressway, opened between the Sea Breeze Expressway (now assigned as a major aspect of NYÃÂ 47) and Five Mile Line Road. In the middle of, USÃÂ 104 crossed Irondequoit Bay by method for the Irondequoit Bay Bridge. USÃÂ 104's previous surface arrangement somewhere in the range of NYÃÂ 47 and Five Mile Line Road was redesignated NYÃÂ 404 while USÃÂ 104 was briefly realigned onto Five Mile Line Road between the freeway and Ridge Road to interface with its previous arrangement. 

The section of I-81 through focal New York was based on an arrangement that intently paralleled USÃÂ 11 from the Pennsylvania state line northward to the city of Watertown. The bit of I-81 close Maple View was finished in late 1961, at which time USÃÂ 104 was stretched out eastbound over NYÃÂ 126 to meet the new parkway. NYÃÂ 126 was truncated on its west end to the I-81 trade therefore. USÃÂ 104 was redesignated as NYÃÂ 104 , making the course the third to endure the NYÃÂ 104 assignment. As a major aspect of the change, NYÃÂ 104 was stretched out east to NYÃÂ 13, totally superseding NYÃÂ 126. 

By 1978, the facing streets between Five Mile Line Road and NYÃÂ 250 in Webster were finished. NYÃÂ 104 was rerouted eastbound along the roadways while NYÃÂ 404 was reached out over NYÃÂ 104's old arrangement to NYÃÂ 250 in Webster. The area from NYÃÂ 250 to the current freeway at the Wayne County line was worked in the late 1970s while the primary carriageway of NYÃÂ 104 between Five Mile Line Road and NYÃÂ 250 was finished in the mid 1980s. NYÃÂ 404 was broadened east along the previous arrangement of NYÃÂ 104 to the province line upon the all out consummation of the Five Mile Line RoadÃ¢ÂÂNYÃÂ 250 fragment. 

NYÃÂ 104 has two suffixed courses, the two of which were relegated . 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 104 Truck is a long truck course of NYÃÂ 104 through the city of Rochester and town of Irondequoit in Monroe County. The course, which exists in the eastward heading just, reaches out from the slopes interfacing NYÃÂ 104 to St. Paul Street east along East Ridge Road to Hudson Avenue, where it swings south to get to NYÃÂ 104. A long section of NYÃÂ 104 Truck pursues the previous arrangement of USÃÂ 104 east along East Ridge Road from St. Paul Street to Hudson Avenue.
