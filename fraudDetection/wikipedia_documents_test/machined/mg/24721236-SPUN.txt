Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, co-makers of "Phineas and Ferb," brought together plot components to mock time travel films, for example, "The Time Machine" (1960) and the "Back to the Future" set of three (1985-1990). Various scenes in the scene were intended to be somewhat befuddling and hard to comprehend so as to premium watchers so they would watch the scene on different occasions, endeavoring to gain some new useful knowledge each time. 

The scene got commonly positive surveys from TV pundits. In its unique communicate, it positioned fourth in the key socioeconomics Boys 6Ã¢ÂÂ14, Kids 6Ã¢ÂÂ11 and Boys 6Ã¢ÂÂ11, totaling 599,000 watchers, a 88 percent expansion from that of the earlier year's evaluations in the timeslot.

It visitor featured performing artists Jennifer Stone, Moises Arias, Noah Munck, and Jennifer Gray, alongside the band Bowling for Soup, who showed up as themselves playing an all-inclusive rendition of the arrangement's signature tune, "Today is Gonna Be a Great Day," which was likewise included on the authority "Phineas and Ferb" soundtrack which was discharged on September 22, 2009. 

Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb gain from their companion Baljeet that an apparatus they requirement for their most recent task presently can't seem to be concocted. They and their companion Isabella acquire the time machine in plain view at the nearby exhibition hall to travel twenty years into what's to come. When they arrive, Isabella remains behind with the time machine while the young men enter their sister Candace's lawn, where her children Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The young men persuade their future nephews to be dynamic and consequently are given the instrument they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back annoying recollections of failing to be ready to bust the young men. She takes her mom Linda to the exhibition hall where the young men leave, directly before Linda can see them. 

Teacher Onassis, who imagined the time machine during the 1800s, lands in the first form of the machine not long after and future Candace takes it. She ventures out back to the day the young men manufactured the rollercoaster in their terrace and prevails with regards to getting her mom to see them, at long last satisfying her fantasy of busting them. Nonetheless, in doing as such, she unintentionally drives Perry, their pet platypus who is furtively a smooth mystery specialist, to be harmed while halting a malevolent magnet system. Subsequently, Perry's adversary, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, turns out safe from the impacts of the now-annihilated machine. After some time, everything is changed and the Tri-State Area moves toward becoming childproof because of a paranoid fear of a rehash of Phineas and Ferb's risky exercises. Doofenshmirtz in the long run picks up the high ground, viably turning into the ruler. He professes to be a pleasant Emperor, however, since he can recollect everybody's name (however this is extensively simpler than it appears, since one of his guidelines is that everybody must be named Joe and expects everybody to wear sterile jackets consistently). Additionally, on account of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is currently constrained into a vow to obey him, coming about a dispirited Perry to bomb more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is illegal to utilize the time machine that Candace recently utilized as recommended by Major Monogram. Subsequent to touching base in the tragic future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a garbage yard and comes back to the day of the rollercoaster to prevent herself from meddling like previously, preventing the oppressed world from happening. 

The time machine gets obliterated so the two Candaces go to the lawn to persuade the young men to fix the present time machine in the historical center and take them back, making a conundrum and subsequently, the Candace from the disheartening future(wearing a white sterile jacket as found in the image above) stops to exist. The young men at that point fix the machine. Isabella says to Ferb that a rollercoaster ride and time travel was a reward. The present Candace follows alongside her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace "at long last" busting them all the while, however the future Linda isn't angry at the young men, saying she doesn't have purview to bust the young men any longer). As Candace and the young men converse with the future Linda, Isabella starts a thought and goes back in time. Subsequent to coming back to right now, Candace leaves in triumph, presently cheerful that she had at last (in fact) busted her siblings. Amid the credits, it uncovers Isabella got the apparatus and offered it to the young men before they even time traveled in any case. This makes them alter their opinions about going into the future, in this way, counteracting every one of the occasions that happened before in the scene and furthermore causing every one of the characters associated with the future to stop presence (likewise eradicating the "busting" present Candace caused, therefore potentially causing a period circle). In "Summer Belongs To You", Phineas makes reference to time traveling twice and Isabella remarks that Phineas has gone through time "twice", but since of the occasions in the credits of Quantum Boogaloo, nobody - including Isabella ought to really think about the time-traveling. 

Amid this scene, it is suggested that Isabella weds either Phineas or Ferb, however none of the characters recall this. It is additionally suggested that Phineas succeeds at least one Nobel Prize as the future Linda says the future Phineas is "in Switzerland for the Awards Ceremony." Ferb is likely President of the United States as he is expressed to be "at Camp David", a hotel uncommonly made for Presidents since Eisenhower, in spite of the fact that his British birth, and not being 35 years of age yet, would usually avoid this. An almost certain situation would be that Ferb is hitched to Vanessa, and is at Camp David with his significant other President Vanessa Doofensmirtz as she would fit both the birth and age necessity. 

"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" was composed by Scott Peterson and coordinated by Zac Moncrief. "Phineas and Ferb" had recently created a scene in season one's "Better late than never" which highlighted a time machine. Co-maker Dan Povenmire expressed that he delighted in the result of said scene. The essayists intentionally left the time machine accessible for the young men's utilization toward the finish of the scene so they could reuse it in a later scene. In the long run, they imagined a plot where "Phineas and Ferb go into the future and really consider Candace to be a grown-up (which) hauls up a wide range of recollections of not having the capacity to bust them." 

The scenes in which Candace makes a trip back to the Phineas and Ferb building a thrill ride are taken from the pilot scene, "Rollercoaster." Including the scenes was "incredible fun" for Povenmire and individual co-maker Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, who chose at an opportune time that utilizing it would have "future Candace return to the rollercoaster . At that point whatever she did would influence the future, for this situation give Doofenshmirtz the advantage and viably change history." The consideration was motivated by the "" scene "Preliminaries and Tribble-ations," in which the "Profound Space 9" team venture out back so as to the "" scene "The Trouble with Tribbles." The epic methodology was seen by Marsh as "an extraordinary method to intertwine a story." 

The team invested a long measure of energy plotting out the scene in a room, utilizing sticky notes, so as to ensure it played out reasonably and was obviously justifiable to watchers. The generation staff based a ton of the use of time travel in "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" on those from the "Back to the Future" set of three (1985-1990) and H. G. Wells' "The Time Machine" (1960). The objective of the group was to ensure everything remained solid to a specific legitimate angle, which prompted a few dreamlike discussions, including a few Catch 22s including time travel. The team individuals tried to wander into components that appeared to be entangled, as their kids watchers were considered sufficiently clever to see such components. The expectations of the creation staff was to make the scene one that they could watch on various occasions and notice something new with each review. 

Since Doofenshmirtz and Perry's activities will in general influence those of the young men, the decision to have future Candace's obstruction in the past significantly influence those of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's was viewed as the intelligent decision. Povenmire clarified, "They influence each other in manners that we never completely see, however in the event that you lose that little level of influence of their [respective] exercises, crap could hit the fan." The melody Doofenshmirtz sings, entitled "It's Been a Charmed Life," was well-commended by the generation group, who felt that it was extensively well-taken care of. The melody brought together the incongruity encompassing Doofenshmirtz having everything go well for him, a topic totally not the same as that which is commonly contacted upon in the arrangement. 

The scene where Candace specifies that her closest companion Stacy Hirano had turned into the leader of Uruguay was initially composed as a disposable joke for the scene. Amid an email trade between the group, some team individuals were interested about the line and Povenmire concocted a whole back story, in which Stacy meets the sovereign of the nation, moves there and, in the wake of changing a few laws, winds up qualified for the administration. The staff appreciated the thought and recorded it as a conceivable plot for a future scene. 

"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" included different visitor appearances. Performer Jennifer Stone visitor featured as Amanda, Candace's future little girl.

Moises Arias, who is, as indicated by Stone, "as [her] younger sibling," voiced Candace's future child, Fred. Performing artist Jennifer Gray likewise showed up as a curator. Dim's character in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" was the motivation for Candace and the performing artist had recently depicted Doofenshmirtz's teacher in "Oil on Candace."

"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" fills in as a satire of time travel films, especially the "Back to the Future" film arrangement and H. G. Wells' "The Time Machine." Candace taking the time machine to change something previously, in this manner making a tragic future, reflects the scene in "Back to the Future Part II" (1989), in which Biff Tannen takes the Delorean time machine and causes a dull and turbulent future simultaneously. Later on, the American pop-punk band Bowling for Soup shows up and plays out an all-inclusive form of the arrangement's signature melody.
