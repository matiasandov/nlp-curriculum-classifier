Up Where We Belong 

"Up Where We Belong" is a melody composed by Jack Nitzsche, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Will Jennings that was recorded by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes for the 1982 film "An Officer and a Gentleman". Warnes was prescribed to sing a tune from the film on account of her past soundtrack triumphs, and she had the thought for the tune to be a two part harmony that she would perform with Cocker. Jennings chose different segments of the score by Nitsche and Sainte-Marie in making the structure of the tune and included verses about the battles of life and love and the deterrents in the manner that we endeavor to evade. It was discharged in July of that year to concur with the arrival of the film. 

The melody achieved number one on the "Announcement" Hot 100 in the US and topped the diagrams in a few different nations. It additionally sold more than one million duplicates in the US and was perceived by the Recording Industry Association of America as one of the Songs of the Century. Cocker and Warnes were granted the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and Nitzsche, Sainte-Marie, and Jennings won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. 

In 1984, the gospel team BeBe and CeCe Winans recorded a religious variety of the tune that got airplay on Christian radio stations, and their redo in 1996 earned them a GMA Dove Award. Different renditions of the tune have additionally been utilized to spoof the last scene of the film on network shows, for example, "Family Guy", "The Simpsons", and "South Park". The way that the tune is a ditty was viewed as a slip in Cocker's profession, which had been based on performing rock and soul. 

On February 24, 1982, English vocalist Joe Cocker performed "I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today" with the jazz bunch the Crusaders at the Grammy Awards. Their coordinated effort on the melody for a Crusaders collection had earned an assignment that year in the class of Best Inspirational Performance. Vocalist lyricist Jennifer Warnes saw the show from home. She had been a fanatic of Cocker's since her adolescents and at one time had a notice of him on her divider indicating him performing at Woodstock, and her adoration for the artist was as yet clear on this night numerous years after the fact. "I was so moved, I was hollering so anyone can hear with bliss, hopping up and downÃ¢Â ... After a troublesome fight with medications and liquor, Joe was in all out order by and by. I knew right then and there that I would sing with Joe." 

In the mean time, plans were being made for "An Officer and a Gentleman" to be appropriated by Paramount Pictures, and studio official Frank Mancuso was obstinate after having some sort of music to use to advance the film. The chief of the film, Taylor Hackford, was additionally keen on delivering a unique title melody to help showcase it, however there was no outstanding spending plan for such a chronicle. He continued with the thought in any case, working with Joel Sill, who was head of music at Paramount at the time, without any other individual at the studio realizing that they were doing as such. The chief reached his companion Gary George to counsel with in regards to the choice of a chronicle craftsman for the melody. George, the previous head of attention at Warner Bros. Records, had as of late turned into a chief and recommended Warnes, who was a customer of his. 

One of the six melodies that Warnes had set in the top portion of the "Announcement" Hot 100 by then was the number six hit "Ideal Time of the Night" from 1977. Her soundtrack credits incorporated the Oscar-designated "One More Hour" from "Jazz" and the Oscar-winning "It Goes Like It Goes" from "Norma Rae", which, similar to the Hackford film, likewise had a lead female character who worked in a production line. Hackford at first rejected the possibility of Warnes singing a tune for "An Officer and a Gentleman" "since he felt she had too sweet a sound," yet Warnes met with Sill and talked about the likelihood of doing as such: "I recommended to Joel that I sing on that film in a two part harmony with Joe Cocker." Sill thought this was an intriguing thought yet expected to persuade Hackford of that. He stated, "I talked about with Taylor, since the film revolved truly around Richard [Gere] and Debra [Winger] basically, that perhaps we ought to have a two part harmony" and that with Cocker and Warnes they would be "coordinating the characters somewhat. The dynamic between the two was the delicate and the unpleasant, that, somewhat, Debra Winger's character was extremely, exceptionally delicate in the image, despite the fact that she was in a harsh situation. Also, Richard Gere's character, somewhat, was extremely an unpleasant character until he was diminished up by her." Hackford thought the thought had potential and now had another companion in the music business to request some help. Chris Blackwell was the proprietor of Island Records, and Cocker was presently recording for Island. "I called Chris and said I need to do this, and he just, on the telephone, stated, 'alright, I'll get this going. What might at first persuade Cocker to chip away at the task, be that as it may, was a little part of the verses. He portrayed it as "the 'Up' part, which is the thing that influenced me to acknowledge it had hit potential. It was so abnormal Ã¢ÂÂ that 'Adoration, lift us upÃ¢Â ... 

The last scene of the film conveyed the story to a cheerful completion, and Hackford needed to have a melody playing amid the end acknowledges that would go about as an impression of the relationship depicted and fuse the signature music formed by Jack Nitzsche and Buffy Saint-Marie. Nitzsche needed to have Sainte-Marie compose the verses, yet her experience in society music caused Sill and Hackford to look somewhere else. Ledge welcomed a lyricist who he'd worked with previously, Will Jennings, to the studio to see a harsh cut of the film, and that gave Jennings motivation for the structure and verses of what moved toward becoming "Up Where We Belong". "And all through the film I was hearing these odds and ends of music, and toward the finish of it I had it in my mind, you know, how there was a tune. I heard a chorale here and a section here and an extension there, thus when I completed, Joel was there, and I stated, 'Joel, simply give me all the music from it,' the majority of Nitzsche's music, '<nowiki> '</nowiki>cause I got a thought. At the point when Jennings gave Hackford his demo, the chief felt it was the ideal fit. 

As indicated by Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, "Up Where We Belong" is written in like manner time. It is in the key of D major and sung in a vocal range from A to G. The verses "recount the battles of life and love and the impediments in the manner that we endeavor to avoid." 

Ledge depicted Stewart Levine as the "record maker who we felt would give us the correct elucidation of the tune, add some depth to it and furthermore make it a hit record in the meantime," yet Levine was reluctant about going from his home upstate New York to California for the activity. He felt it would be advantageous, notwithstanding, on the grounds that Jennings was included. At the point when Jennings played the demo via telephone for him, Levine reacted that it was "incredible", and Warnes was sure "Up Where We Belong" would be a hit. Cocker, then again, depicted the demo as "appalling", in spite of his valuation for a portion of the verses and the way that Jennings was the lyricist on "I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today" and his later single, "Sassing the Night". 

Cocker needed to make the chronicle independent from anyone else, so Levine had Warnes record her vocals independently. Cocker had enjoyed a reprieve from visiting to travel to Los Angeles for the session, yet when it came time to record he, as Hackford portrayed it, "was alarmed. He would not like to go into the studio. Stewart Levine needed to proceed to work him out of the lodging to get him there." Cocker conceded, "I'd sat with the words toward the evening yet at the same time hadn't recollected that them, so we needed to draw them up on huge squares of wood and stuff." An account was made where the two voices were grafted together, yet Warnes clarified how influential their maker was in getting Cocker to consent to record the tune close by her: "Stewart Levine was delicately tenacious on the two part harmony. Stewart comprehended that the difference in our voices, the aural science, would work. So Joe and I sang the tune together. A couple of takes, that was all." Cocker came around to seeing a hit tune once it was finished, saying, "I realized it was a main. Other individuals were stating, 'WellÃ¢Â ... maybe', yet I could simply feel it." 

Hackford said that "the last form was total magicÃ¢ÂÂor in any event Joel and I suspected as much." They currently needed to exhibit this tune they weren't planned to make to the officials at Paramount. "When we played it for Michael Eisner and Don Simpson, they loathed the record and said it could never be a hit." Simpson even wagered Sill $100 that it wouldn't be. Hackford and Sill "called another unmistakable record official, who stated, 'Overlook it. Jennifer Warnes has never had a hit melody and Joe Cocker's a has-been. Eisner and Simpson made Hackford "meet with different account craftsman companions of theirs who attempted to compose tunes, yet their title tunes didn't fit the motion picture." Hackford stated, "At long last, one of the renowned specialists who was included taken a gander at the film and stated, shockingly, 'Hello, I can compose something, yet it won't fill in just as the melody you have. Since they were coming up short on time before the film's discharge, Eisner and Simpson at long last gave in, and "Up Where We Belong" made the finished product of the film and was discharged as a solitary on July 22, 1982. 

Some radio stations would not play "Up Where We Belong", notwithstanding venturing to such an extreme as to send their duplicates back to Island Records. Cocker stated, "I went into their workplaces in New York. I strolled in and I stated, 'How's the single doing?' And this person Mike Abrahams, who worked there, he stated, 'This is the way well it's doing'Ã¢ÂÂand the workplace was heaped with returns." The single may have been recorded to advance the film, yet Warnes brought up that, as it were, the accomplishment of the film was what sold the record. 

"Up Where We Belong" appeared on the "Bulletin" Hot 100 in the issue dated August 21 of that year and delighted in 3 weeks at number one amid its 23 weeks there. That equivalent issue additionally denoted its first appearance on the magazine's rundown of the 50 most well known Adult Contemporary tunes in the US, where it remained for 25 weeks, six of which were at its pinnacle position at number three. It likewise achieved number seven on the UK Singles Chart in 1983 and got Silver accreditation from the British Phonographic Industry on February 1 of that year for achieving offers of 250,000 duplicates. The Recording Industry Association of America granted the tune both Gold and Platinum accreditation for accomplishing offers of 500,000 and one million duplicates, individually, on January 17, 1989. 

"Board" looked into the single at the season of its discharge in their July 31 issue. "This improbable vocal matching could demonstrate to a lesser extent a long shot than it sounds, given the ongoing additions made by other soundtrack affiliations. Include radio's progressing warmth for solid two part harmonies and a controlled exhibition by Cocker that matches him all the more thoughtfully with Warnes' gentler style, and this track should discover companions at A/C and standard pop stations." Matthew Greenwald of AllMusic expressed, "A gospel-propelled bit of pop tune craftsmanship, the tune moves with a fundamental elegance and unobtrusive excellence. Confidence, ethicalness, and, indeed, the intensity of adoration is at the expressive center here, and [the songwriters] pass on this with a proficient and immortal style. Really a current pop standard." 

On January 29, 1983, Jennings, Nitzsche and Sainte-Marie won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Cocker and Warnes won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals on February 23 of that year. After two months, on April 11, the musicians won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. They additionally won the BAFTA film grant for Best Original Song in 1984. On the Songs of the Century list assembled by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2001 the tune was recorded at number 323. In 2004 it completed at number 75 on AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Songs review of top tunes in American film, and in 2016 one of the team's live interpretations of the melody was recorded at number 18 on "Moving Stone's" rundown of the 20 Greatest Best Song Oscar Performances. 

Warnes and Cocker kept to an understanding that they could never lip-synchronize their exhibitions of the melody. One of their soonest live appearances was on the November 20, 1982, scene of "Strong Gold". "Saturday Night Live" pursued on February 5, 1983, and their execution at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards came soon thereafter, on February 23. Behind the stage at the Grammys Warnes said about working with Cocker, "I was told it was the most unusual matching ever," and in regards to their April 11 appearance at the 55th Academy Awards, she conceded, "Neither of us were agreeable in the Oscar world. Joe performing in a white tuxedo, me in pink taffetaÃ¢ÂÂhow silly." 

In 2013 Cocker was respected in Berlin with a Goldene Kamera grant, and Warnes went along with him to sing the tune at the service. The day after Cocker's demise in 2014 Warnes stated, "I understood yesterday that we will never sing our tune again. That idea makes me feel wiped out. We met a year ago in Berlin to sing together. I didn't realize that would be our last time." Her instinctive response to his passing parallels the incredible science they had in their numerous exhibitions of the melody, which she had summed up years sooner: "I generally thought the blending had a solid ring of truth to it. It was so far-fetched, on the grounds that Joe has this outstanding, extremely crude, manly vitality. I was less outstanding and had this entirely powerless, quintessential female vitality and we were very spellbound, as people regularly are nowadays. However, we compromised." 

The accomplishment of "Up Where We Belong" was not without its downsides for Cocker. He conceded that Island Records proprietor Chris Blackwell additionally despised the melody and wasn't keen on discharging it. They had put out Cocker's first venture for the name, "Sheffield Steel", in June 1982, only a month prior to the melody should have been on store racks if it somehow managed to agree with the opening of the film. Cocker stated, "The melody was recorded inside only hours. "Sheffield Steel" Ã¢ÂÂ I went through a year on that. What's more, the single obscured it medium-term." But notwithstanding overlooking its prosperity, Blackwell was pestered by the way that the two part harmony wasn't R&B, which is the thing that he was going for on "Sheffield Steel". 

Stewart Levine created Cocker's next LP, which was proposed for Island, be that as it may, the artist uncovered, likewise with the two part harmony, Blackwell detested it, so Cocker left Island for Capitol. The new mark additionally had misgivings about the quantity of moderate ditties included on the new task. Another maker was acquired to give the collection an alternate tone, and the outcome was the 1984 discharge "Acculturated Man". Cresting at number 133 on the "Bulletin" 200, it was his most minimal outlining studio collection in the US by then. 

State house had been in charge of reviving the professions of Tina Turner and Heart in the mid-80s, so a push was on to do as such for their new customer with his next undertaking, the 1986 collection "Cocker". Legislative hall's VP of a&r, Don Grierson, clarified, "After "Acculturated Man" turned out, Joe, Michael Lang [Cocker's manager], and I invested a great deal of energy focusing in on exactly what the hell Joe Cocker was actually about. What's more, it's my firm conviction that Joe is a rocker." His inclination was that "Up Where We Belong" ended up being a twofold edged sword. "It helped Joe in one sense, however it was, extremely unfavorable to him in another. It gave him a hit record and took his name back to the mass market once more. In any case, since it was such a pop, widely appealing record, it removed Joe's underlying foundations according to the general population and absolutely in the business." 

Credits adjusted from collection liner notes for "The Best of Joe Cocker". 

TV minister Tammy Faye Bakker recommended that BeBe and CeCe Winans, two of the artists from The PTL Club, record "Up Where We Belong" after she heard the first two part harmony in a record store, and Larnelle Harris helped BeBe make the verses all the more speaking to a Christian group of onlookers. Their 1984 front of the melody from their collection "Ruler Lift Us Up" achieved number 27 on the Christian Radio Hits graph issued by SoundScan. The team rerecorded their gospel form in 1996 for their "Most noteworthy Hits" collection, and their new form won the 1998 GMA Dove Award for Contemporary Gospel Song of the Year. 

The piece of the score of "An Officer and a Gentleman" that Jennings utilized recorded as a hard copy the chorale for "Up Where We Belong" can be heard in the last scene of the film in which Gere lifts Winger up in his arms and does her of the plant past applauding collaborators. The last shot of the film solidifies on their exit as the score goes to a major symphonic completion, and the credits begin to move as Cocker and Warnes start singing the melody at the ensemble. In spite of the fact that "Up Where We Belong" is heard independently from the last scene, it has regularly replaced the score in send-ups of the great finale throughout the years. Movies and TV programs that have utilized some variety of the melody in doing this incorporate "Bridget Jones' Baby", "The Cleveland Show", 

"Everyone Hates Chris", "Family Guy", "Companions", "The Goldbergs", "The Office", "Sabrina the Teenage Witch", "Scours", "The Simpsons", and "South Park".
