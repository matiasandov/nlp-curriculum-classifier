Amphidromus 

Amphidromus is a sort of tropical air-breathing area snails, earthbound pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Camaenidae. The shells of "Amphidromus" are moderately extensive, from to in most extreme measurement, and especially vivid. Amid the eighteenth century, they were among the primary Indonesian land snail shells conveyed to Europe by voyagers and pioneers. From that point forward, the variety has been broadly examined: a few thorough monographs and inventories were created by naturalists and zoologists amid the timeframe from the mid nineteenth to the mid twentieth hundreds of years. Present day thinks about have concentrated on better understanding the transformative connections inside the gathering, just as taking care of ordered issues. 

The family "Amphidromus" is irregular in that it incorporates species that have dextral shell-winding and species that have sinistral shell-looping. Likewise, a few species inside this class are especially eminent in light of the fact that their populaces at the same time incorporate people with left-gave and right-gave shell-looping. This is an amazingly uncommon marvel, and fascinating to scholars. Concentrates concentrated on the delicate life structures of "Amphidromus" are dissipated and fragmentary. Data on the inside life systems is known just from a couple of animal categories, and no bigger, similar morphological examination has ever been done. 

Species in the variety "Amphidromus" are arboreal Ã¢ÂÂ at the end of the day, they are tree snails. Nonetheless, progressively definite data on their propensities is as yet deficient. The general bolstering propensities for these snails are obscure, yet a couple of animal groups are known to benefit from minute organisms, lichens or earthly green growth. "Amphidromus" themselves are gone after by winged animals, snakes, and likely additionally by littler warm blooded creatures, for example, rodents. 

The conventional name is gotten from the antiquated Greek words ' (), signifying "on the two sides", and ' (), signifying "running", insinuating the diverse chiralities of the shells. The shells of "Amphidromus" are generally extensive, and very brilliant; impressive quantities of them were among the principal Indonesian land snail shells took back to Europe by voyagers and wayfarers amid the eighteenth century. Nearly, malacologists have accumulated an a lot more modest number of examples. 

A few animal categories and structures were depicted before 1800, a large portion of them with deficient territory information. No less than two names Ã¢ÂÂ "Amphidromus laevus" (MÄÅºller, 1774) and the structure "A. perversus" f. "aureus" Martyn, 1784 Ã¢ÂÂ still (starting at 2017) have not yet been accounted for from an exact region. Amid the main portion of the nineteenth century, numerous species and assortments were named, again as a rule with poor territory information. Not until Eduard von Martens (1867) distributed his monograph was there an endeavor to cover the whole perplexing of species inside this sort. The 1867 monograph contained impressive data both on the variety inside the sort, and on the issues of the geographic dispersion of the species. Numerous ideas that began with von Martens are still (starting at 2017) being used. 

In 1896, Hugh Fulton composed 142 explicit and varietal names into eighteen species bunches containing an aggregate of 64 animal varieties. At the point when Henry Augustus Pilsbry's 1900 monograph "Manual of Conchology" showed up, the quantity of species in the class "Amphidromus" had expanded to 81, and these were set in nineteen gatherings. Pilsbry's investigation has remained the main outlined monograph of the family, and it is still viewed as essential for any genuine investigation of the sort. 

Since 1900, the major ordered examinations on "Amphidromus" have been faunistic (an investigation of the fauna of some domain or territory) in degree. The papers of American malacologist Paul Bartsch (1917, 1918, 1919) on the Philippine species, Bernhard Rensch (1932) on the Lesser Sunda Islands structures, and Tera van Benthem Jutting (1950, 1959) on Javan and Sumatran populaces are particularly complete. Possibly the most significant commitment is that of Curt Haniel (1921), who talked about the variety inside "A. contrarius" and "A. reflexilabris" on Timor; the varieties in shading and structure were very much delineated in a progression of shading plates. 

Writing distributed after 1900 contains many dissipated portrayals of new shading structures and subspecies. Of the 309 names in the nomenclatural list, 111 (35.9%) were distributed after Pilsbry (1900). Adolf Michael Zilch (1953) recorded sort examples in the Senckenberg Museum, and delineated numerous already unfigured species. Straightforward Fortescue Laidlaw and Alan Solem (1961) perceived 74 species by name, and thought about that material from the Banda Islands most likely spoke to an undescribed species. Eleven of the species perceived by Laidlaw and Solem were portrayed after the presence of Pilsbry's monograph. In any case, a few species perceived by Pilsbry have thusly been subjected to subspecific or varietal status, and a couple of names have been exchanged to incertae sedis, since they depend on hundred-year-old references that have not been substantiated by later gatherers. Actually, the investigation by Laidlaw and Solem (1961) shapes an enhancement to Pilsbry's monograph with his broad plates, and a significant number of Laidlaw and Solem's decisions concerning the connections of shading frames depicted as species were taken not such a great amount from new examples, yet from the degree of variety that was illustrated by Haniel (1921) in his pioneer contemplate. 

Species in the class "Amphidromus" for the most part have smooth, lustrous, brilliantly hued, extend or conic, dextrally or sinistrally curled shells. The shells are decently huge, extending from to in most extreme measurement, having from 6 to 8 raised whorls. Their shading design is normally monochromatic yellowish or greenish, however can be variegated. The opening is slanted or applaud fit as a fiddle, with no teeth or folds, and with the gap tallness going from two-fifths to 33% of absolute shell stature. The peristome is extended as well as reflected, and is in some cases thickened. The columella might be straight or recurved, and the parietal callus is powerless to well-created, and the umbilicus might be open or shut. The radula is spatulate, has cusped teeth organized in lines, typically with a monocuspid focal tooth and bicuspid or tricuspid parallel teeth. The jaw is slender and frail, with low level ribs. The pallial district is sigmurethrous, with an extremely long, thin kidney. The genitalia are that of normal camaenids, with a long fundamental container, a short penis with low inclusion of the retractor muscle, and a short or long epiphallic caecum (flagellum and reference section). The spermatophores have a pentagonal framework in cross-segment. "Amphidromus" are regularly arboreal creatures. 

The shells of "Amphidromus" are moderately huge, from one to three inches high, and bright. "Amphidromus" has a stretch conic or praise conic helicoid shell of 5 to 8 whorls. The shell might be meager and delicate, or extremely overwhelming and strong, with no known connection of shell structure with circulation or living spaces. 

In certain species inside this class, the shell curls perpetually to one side, and in numerous others similarly as constantly to one side. In any case, a noteworthy number of animal categories in this sort are "amphidromine"; this term implies that both left-and right-gave shell looping are found inside a similar populace. One could state they are "polymorphic" for the bearing of shell winding, but since there are just two conceivable sorts of shell looping, they are depicted as "dimorphic" in snaking. The two sorts of shell snaking happen in certain species in around equivalent numbers, different species have an unmistakable prevalence of one stage. There is up 'til now no data on the heredity of this character in "Amphidromus". 

Since practically all different types of amphidromine gastropods, for example, ones inside the genera "Partula" and "Achatinella", have just turned out to be terminated, the family "Amphidromus", containing more than 110 species, is particularly helpful for the investigation of the advancement of asymmetry in creatures, and this is the reason the preservation of this variety is of basic significance to researcher. 

The whorls of the shell of types of "Amphidromus" are tolerably curved and, with just a couple of exemptions, are smooth or have a black out model of development lines. Be that as it may, a model of decently substantial diagonal spiral ribs has showed up no less than four separate occasions in the family, and can be found in the accompanying species: "Amphidromus costifer" Smith from Binh Dinh Province in Vietnam; "A. begini" Morlet from Cambodia; "A. heccarii" Tapparone-Canefri from Celebes; and the "A. palaceus"- "A. winteri" complex from Java and Sumatra. Associated with the ribbing is a light, monochrome tinge, and a flimsy shell with a substantial opening and a flaring lip. Numerous strong shells in different species do demonstrate a slight roughening of the surface, yet this is altogether different from the ribbed figure referenced previously. 

The opening is commonly vast, differing from around two-fifths to 33% the tallness of the shell, frequently inside a similar populace. Generally the lip is at any rate to some degree extended, and in structures, for example, "A. reflexilabris" Schepman and "A. winteri" (Pfeiffer) var. "inauris" Fulton, the lip must be called flaring. In "A. perversus" (Linnaeus) and most other thick-shelled species, the lip is inside thickened, shaping a "move" in its development, and has an extremely overwhelming parietal callus. In slim shelled species, the lip is generally a basic reflected edge. The umbilical zone can be in part open, almost shut, or fixed. This component once in a while gives a valuable foundation to explicit distinguishing proof. The point of the parietal divider changes, however no exact data on this has been assembled. 

By and large the whorls of the shell increment rather normally in size, be that as it may, species which are likely firmly related, for example, "A. sinistralis" (Reeve) and "A. heccarii" Tapparone-Canefri, can have very extraordinary degrees of whorl increase. No endeavor has been made to express these distinctions meristically, since the majority of the accessible material was deficient for factual treatment. Real elements of the shell change significantly both inside and between species. The base grown-up size is about 21Ã¢Â mm high, the watched greatest about 75Ã¢Â mm. There isn't much variety in grown-up size inside species: just a couple of animal types, outstandingly "A. maculiferus", "A. sinensis" and "A. entobaptus", have a variety in grown-up size that is more noteworthy than seven or eight millimeters altogether. 

The absolute most significant part of shell variety inside the family is the shading designing. As a rule, numerous arboreal snails are brilliantly hued, clear models being the bulimulid genera "Drymaeus" and "Liguus", the cepolid "Polymita", and the camaenid "Papuina". Be that as it may, "Polymita", "Liguus" and "Amphidromus" are especially noted for their shading varieties. The fundamental ground shade of "Amphidromus" has all the earmarks of being yellow, and this shading is more often than not (with the exception of "Amphidromus entobaptus") restricted to the surface layers of the shell, since worn examples seem, by all accounts, to be almost without shading. In certain species the foundation shading is whitish, and a couple have dull foundation hues. The apical whorls are pale, purple, dark colored, or dark, and this occasionally changes inside a populace (as in "A. quadrasi"). A couple of animal types, for instance "A. schomburgki", have a deciduous green periostracum. 

Consistent zonal examples can appear as whitish subsutural groups ("A. similis"), substantial subperipheral pigmentation ("A. perversus" var. "infraviridis"), subsutural shading lines ("A. columellaris"), expansive winding shading groups ("A. metabletus", "A. webbi"), or slender winding groups ("A. laevus"). Intruded on zonation can comprise of the interference of groups into spots in ("A. maculatus"); very sporadic part of zones ("A. perversus" vars. "sultanus" and "interruptus"); development of sideways outspread streaks which run parallel to (in "A. inversus") or cross (in "A. latestrigatus") the steady development lines; or pretty much every possible mix and variety of these variables. Frequently the example will change drastically from the zenith to the body whorl (in "A. quadrasi" vars.). The gap, parietal callus, columella, lip, and umbilical area are differently set apart with pink, dark colored, purple, white, or dark. Haniel (1921) incorporates a few shading plates which obviously exhibit the degree of shading variety inside two types of the "Syndromus" type. "A. perversus" and "A. maculiferus" of the subgenus "Amphidromus" are similarly factor, though species, for example, "A. inversus" and "A. similis" are practically uniform in hue. 

In shells of the vast majority of the species in the subgenus "Amphidromus", resting stages are set apart by the affidavit of a dark colored or dark spiral band called a varix. This has all the earmarks of being uncommon in the subgenus "Syndromus", despite the fact that the shell of "A. laevus" shows proof of interference of the winding banding after a resting stage. 

Species acknowledgment depends on blends of minor auxiliary varieties in the shape, opening, whorl form, umbilical area, and shading design. It seems, by all accounts, to be the situation that numerous species have a steady shading example, while different species appear to fluctuate colossally. Satisfactory unselected field tests will empower a superior comprehension of the relative steadiness or changeability of specific species in single areas. 

Data concerning the delicate life structures of "Amphidromus" is broadly dispersed and fragmentary. The most total record is that of Arnold Jacobi (1895) on examples from Great (Natuna Islands) and Djemadja (Anamba Islands). Tragically, in spite of the fact that unmistakably anatomical contrasts exist in the two species Jacobi dismembered, lamentably we don't realize which shapes he took a shot at, on the grounds that he had inaccurately recognized his material. In his paper he alluded to the two species as "Amphidromus chloris" and the "interruptus" period of "A. perversus". In any case, that is beyond the realm of imagination, in light of the fact that as a general rule "Amphidromus chloris" is a species discovered just in the Philippine Islands, and the "interruptus" period of "A. perversus" is absent in the Natuna Islands. 

Carl Arend Friedrich Wiegmann (1893, 1898) talked about parts of the life systems of "A. adamsii", "A. porcellanus", "A. contrarius", and "A. sinistralis". Walter Edward Collinge (1901, 1902) quickly noted highlights of "A. palaceus" and "A. parakensis" (detailed as "A. perversus"). Haniel (1921) dismembered "A. contrarius" and "A. reflexilabris", and Bernhard Rensch distributed a couple of dispersed notes in his different faunistic studies. A couple of prior notes are referenced in Pilsbry (1900). 

Characters, for example, the long, slender kidney with reflexed ureter and shut optional ureter, the penial complex with particular penis, which is nonstop with the epiphallus, epiphallic caecum (a flagellum and an informative supplement), unbranched gametolytic channel, absence of vaginal adornment organs, and the essential state of the apprehensive and retractor muscle frameworks bolster the incorporation of "Amphidromus" in the family Camaenidae. This gathering of snails happen in a wide assortment of natural surroundings in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia, and is a standout amongst the most differing families in the clade Stylommatophora. In spite of the fact that Laidlaw and Solem (1961) gave not any more extra subtleties on the life structures of "Amphidromus", consequent investigations by unmistakable creators, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have shown that the conceptive framework can give profitable information to species acknowledgment. 

Preceding 1900, the comparability fit as a fiddle of the shell of "Amphidromus" to that of South American tree snails in the family Bulimulidae had deceived taxonomists. In any case, the dismemberments made by Wiegmann and Jacobi unmistakably demonstrated that the internal anatomical highlights of "Amphidromus" were equivalent to those of the Asian-Indonesian Camaenidae, and that the likeness of the shell of "Amphidromus" to that of bulimulids was simply a case of parallelism. 

Laidlaw and Solem (1961) perceived 75 species in the variety "Amphidromus", and put another seven names under "incertae sedis". In 2010, 87 species in the class "Amphidromus" were perceived. Species inside the variety "Amphidromus" are isolated into two subgenera, as in the accompanying rundown: 

Initially portrayed as "Helix perversus" by Linnaeus in 1758, "Amphidromus perversus" is the sort types of the class "Amphidromus", by the consequent assignment of Eduard von Martens (1860). Species in the subgenus "Amphidromus" are amphidromine (left-gave and right-gave snails happen inside the populace) with a couple of exemptions. Four dextral taxa are: "A. givenchyi", "A. protania", "A. schomburgki dextrochlorus" and "A. inversus annamiticus"; and one sinistral: "A. atricallosus classiaris". These species for the most part have shells which have ht following qualities: they are expansive (tallness regularly surpassing ); they have a stature/width proportion of under 1.85; and a shell shading which is yellowish or greenish. Anatomically they have a long epiphallus and flagellum, and a reference section is generally present. 

Everything except two species inside the subgenus "Syndromus" are sinistral. The exemptions are the amphidromine "A. glaucolarynx" and the dextral "A. kruehni". The sort types of the subgenus "Syndromus" is "A. contrarius" MÄÅºller, 1774, by the ensuing assignment of Adolf Michael Zilch (1960). Species in the subgenus "Syndromus" have littler shells (stature normally not exactly and tallness/width proportion more prominent than 1.85), with variable shading design. They additionally have a short epiphallus and flagellum, without a supplement. A third conceivable subgenus, "Goniodromus" BÄÅºlow, 1905 (type species "Amphidromus bÄÅºllowi" Fruhstorfer, 1905), is additionally refered to in the writing, however its subgeneric status is yet to be affirmed. 

Sub-atomic investigations of halfway arrangements of 16S rDNA of 18 particular species did by Sutcharit and associates (2007) show that "Amphidromus" is a monophyletic gathering. In their examination, diverse cladograms got through unmistakable strategies, for example, most extreme niggardliness, neighbor joining and greatest probability were harmonious among themselves. Despite the fact that the topology acquired for the subgenus "Amphidromus" was genuinely predictable with current scientific classification, the phylogeny of sinistral "Syndromus" species demonstrated no such correspondence. Likewise as indicated by their outcomes, enantiomorphy is by all accounts the familial condition of shell snaking in the class "Amphidromus", which is in opposition to the general desire for dextrally looped shells as a hereditary condition. 

In spite of being morphologically indistinguishable, a few examples as far as anyone knows having a place with three animal groups, specifically "Amphidromus semitessellatus", "A. xiengensis" and "A. areolatus", clearly had polyphyletic starting points of mtDNA haplotypes. This brought about similar species all the while showing up in unmistakable clades along the topology: for example, "A. areolatus" can be found in two unique clades in Sutcharit and partner's (2007) cladogram, bunched separately with "A. xiengiensis" and furthermore with "A. semitesselatus". As indicated by the creators, these outcomes could be clarified by joined and polymorphic shell shading designs (e.g., the shells of the examples had fundamentally the same as hues and shape, however the mtDNA markers demonstrated critical contrasts). On the other hand, they could likewise be the consequence of introgressive hybridization or familial polymorphism of mtDNA. Regardless, examinations of phylogeography utilizing different markers (atomic markers or other mtDNA markers) or extra morphological characters would even now be important to additionally elucidate these issues. 

Right now, no dependable pre-human fossil events of "Amphidromus" have been recorded. Tera van Benthem Jutting (1932) announced finding a few examples of "A. filozonatus" which had been eaten in ancient occasions by locals, in Sampoeng Cave, focal Java; and a couple of years after the fact (van Benthem Jutting, 1937, pp.Ã¢Â 92Ã¢ÂÂ94) a similar creator revealed a solitary example of "A. palaceus" from the Trinil Beds of Java. Neither one of the records originates before human inhabitance, and thusly these shed no light on the pre-mankind's history of "Amphidromus". 

The class "Amphidromus" ranges from eastern India, in south-western Asia (restricted toward the north by the Himalayas), to northern Australia (constrained eastbound by Weber's Line). "Amphidromus" species are found in territories as pursues: from the Garo Hills and Khasi Hills of Meghalaya in northeastern India; all through Burma, Malay Peninsula, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia as far east as the Sulawesi, Banda Islands, Timor and the Tenimber Islands (yet not on Ceram, Buru, Halmahera, Batjan Island, the Obi Islands, the Aru and Kei Islands or the Talaud Archipelago and some Celebesian satellite islands); in the southern Philippines, eminently Mindanao and the Balabac, Palawan; and in northern Australia (exclusively spoken to by "Amphidromus cognatus"). 

"Amphidromus" species are arboreal land snails. Additional data concerning the propensities and method of life of the types of "Amphidromus" is nearly non-existent, in any case, these snails have for the most part been gathered while they were slithering on trees or bushes. The eating routine of "Amphidromus" is obscure, yet "Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis" is thought to benefit from minuscule parasites, lichens or earthly green growth. 

In spite of the extraordinary assorted variety inside this sort, starting at 2017, extensive life-history investigations of "Amphidromus" species are as yet missing; just a couple of perceptions of conduct of species inside the class exist, and these perceptions are dissipated all through the writing. An examination by Eugen Paravicini (1921) portrayed egg-laying conduct in "Amphidromus palaceus" var. "pura" at Palimanan, West Java. As per Paravicini's perceptions, in October, 1920, local people from West Java acquired two "homes" containing snails that had quite recently started keeping their eggs; one snail had collapsed the outside leaves of a youthful bamboo shoot and gummed them together into a pointed cornet. The shoot hung vertically with the tight end pointed upward, and the wide opening beneath. The upper piece of the sack was loaded up with eggs when gathered. The snail slid gradually, turning around its longitudinal pivot, and kept eggs until the whole cavity was topped off. In the event that a break in the bin presented eggs to the air, they immediately evaporated. Two days after catch, egg-laying was done, and the snail shut the opening by collapsing over more leaves. Likely four days were spent in egg-laying, since the cavity was half filled toward the beginning of perceptions. A second home of correspondingly collapsed mango leaves contained 234 eggs. The volume of eggs for each situation incredibly surpassed the measure of the snail, demonstrating that the eggs must be exemplified just before affidavit. The cases were slim, and dried rapidly upon any presentation to the air. October denoted the beginning of the stormy season and most likely this is the ordinary reproducing period. Eggs of "A. porcellanus" were accounted for by van Benthem Jutting (1950, p.Ã¢Â 493) to have begun incubating just ten days in the wake of being laid. Comparative home structure propensities have been accounted for different species, yet no total investigation of an actual existence cycle has been distributed. Up until 1961, no data was accessible on the cycle of movement, life span, rate of development, and so on. 

Schilthuizen et al. (2005) depicted the spatial structure of a populace of "A. inversus" in Malaysia. Schilthuizen et al. (2007) found that there is sexual choice in mating with snails of the contrary chirality. This implies the left-gave snails mate more frequently with right-gave snails than they do with snails of the equivalent snaking. Also there are anatomical adjustments of the spermatophore and of the female piece of the regenerative framework for the achievement of these matings. 

Predators of "Amphidromus" snails incorporate the red-delegated barbet "Megalaima rafflesii", and most likely other fledgling species. Asian snakes in the family "Pareas" are known to benefit from "Amphidromus" species by expelling the delicate parts from the shells. Numerous shells of "Amphidromus" were found in the cave of a rodent in Malaysia.
