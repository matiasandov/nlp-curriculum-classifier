London Road Fire Station, Manchester 

London Road Fire Station is a previous flame station in Manchester, England. It was opened in 1906, on a site limited by London Road, Whitworth Street, Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street. Structured in the Edwardian Baroque style by Woodhouse, Willoughby and Langham in red block and earthenware, it cost ÃÅ142,000 to manufacture and was worked by J. Gerrard and Sons of Swinton. It has been a Grade II* recorded structure since 1974. 

Notwithstanding a flame station, the structure housed a police headquarters, a rescue vehicle station, a bank, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station. The flame station worked for a long time, lodging the fire fighters, their families, and the pony drawn machines that were supplanted by mechanized vehicles a couple of years after its opening. It was visited by eminence in 1942, in acknowledgment of the detachment's wartime endeavors. After the war it turned into an instructional hub and in 1952 turned into the primary focus prepared to record crisis calls. Nonetheless, the flame station ended up costly to keep up and after board redesign decrease set in. The structure was the base camp of the Manchester Fire Brigade until the unit was supplanted by the Greater Manchester Fire Service in 1974. The flame station shut in 1986, since when it has been to a great extent unused in spite of a few redevelopment recommendations. 

It was set on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010 Manchester City Council served an obligatory buy request on the flame station's proprietor, Britannia Hotels. Britannia declared in 2015 their aim to sell the structure after almost 30 years of abandonment. It was sold to Allied London in 2015 and remodel started in 2018 with the structure to be redeveloped as a blended use including relaxation and inn offices. 

In 1897 the Manchester Watch Committee was thinking about a substitution for its flame station on Jackson's Row. A five-man sub-panel was set up and prescribed a site on Newton Street. In 1899, George William Parker who had structured flame stations in Bootle and Belfast, and been alluded to as the "engineer of the world's flame administration" was named Chief of the Manchester Fire Brigade and 

asked his conclusion on the proposition. Parker revealed that the site on Newton Street was unacceptable and submitted plans for a flame station on a site limited by London Road, Whitworth Street, Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street. 

Parker's proposition was for a 7-narrows fire station on a site more than twofold the extent of the one proposed on Newton Street. The decision of London Road was impacted by its closeness to an improvement of stockrooms on Whitworth Street and Princess Street. Parker persuaded the city gathering to pick his recommendations instead of those on Newton Street. 

A challenge, with prizes of ÃÅ300, ÃÅ200 and ÃÅ100 (proportionate to ÃÅ, ÃÅ and ÃÅ in 2019) was composed to structure the new flame station. The challenge drew enthusiasm from the nation over, pulling in 25Ã¢Â entries. The triumphant section was by John Henry Woodhouse, George Harry Willoughby and John Langham, a group of nearby modelers. Their structure depended intently on Parker's underlying plans. The flame station was portrayed by "Flame Call" magazine as "the best flame station in this round world" before development began. 

The flame station was worked somewhere in the range of 1904 and 1906 at an expense of ÃÅ142,000 (identical to ÃÅ in 2019). The structure's substructure and establishments were worked by C. H. Normanton of Manchester. The superstructure was worked by Gerrard's of Swinton at an expense of ÃÅ75,360. It was looked with red block and earthenware by Burmantofts, a typical decision for mid twentieth century structures in Manchester as it was cleanable and opposed the contamination and corrosive downpour brought about by nearby industry. Other striking Manchester structures from this period utilizing earthenware incorporate the Midland Hotel, the Refuge Assurance Building, the University of Manchester's Sackville Street Building and the Victoria Baths. The structure's outside highlighted sculptural models by John Jarvis Millson speaking to the elements of the structure, for example, equity, flame and water. 

The structure had recolored glass windows and the inside was embellished with coated blocks, like other open structures of this period in the city, for example, the Victoria Baths. The likenesses propose the impact and selection of a standard structure by Henry Price's recently made City Architect's Department. 

The structure was opened on 27 September 1906 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester James Herbert Thewlis. Notwithstanding the flame station, it housed a police headquarters on Whitworth Street, an emergency vehicle station on Minshull Street South, a part of Williams Deacon's Bank at the edge of London Road and Fairfield Street, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station on London Road. The coroner's court and gas-meter testing station supplanted the proposed open library and exercise center. 

The flame station contained pads for 32 fire fighters and their families and 6 single fire fighters. Offices incorporated a clothing, rec center, pool room and youngsters' play-zones. The complex contained stables for the steeds that pulled the fire machines, and a smithy's workshop. There were electric ringers and lights to caution fire fighters to an alert, shafts to speed up the fire fighters' reaction, suspended bridles to enable the ponies to be outfit rapidly, and electric entryways. The flame station was likewise structured with foreknowledge; the apparatus sounds were made sufficiently wide to take mechanized flame machines. The station's previously mechanized flame machine landed in 1911, five years after it opened. 

The structure has a hose tower and a ventilation framework planned by Musgrave and Company to keep the smell from the steeds' slows down entering the firemens' living quarters. Natural air was attracted through the highest point of the flame station's pinnacle, sanitized and coursed around the structure. At the point when the air achieved the finish of the circuit, in the slows down, it was separated from the structure. The framework implied that the air in the structure was supplanted each 10Ã¢Â minutes. 

Amid the Second World War the storm cellar was changed over into an air-assault cover and an augmentation worked in the yard to give more space in the control room. The flame administrations were nationalized in 1941, and London Road turned into the central station of Division C. In acknowledgment of the firemen's endeavors King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the flame station in 1942. 

After the war the Manchester Fire Brigade was again municipalised, and rearranged. London Road Fire Station was reestablished as the home office of the detachment and turned into the main flame station serving the downtown area. A flame administration preparing focus was built up in 1948. At about a similar time, the rescue vehicle station shut and was changed over into the fire detachment's workshops. The control room was modernized in 1952, turning into the first in the nation with gear to record crisis calls. 

The inside was restored in 1955. The outside had been cleaned each year since the flame station opened, and therefore was in unblemished condition when the structure commended its Golden Jubilee on 6 October 1956. 

Before the finish of the 1960s support was winding up progressively costly, and the structure's plan illsuited to present day fire apparatuses. Plans to supplant the flame station were put on hold pending the development of the Greater Manchester Fire Service. 

The structure has been Grade II* recorded since 1974, that year that the substitution of the Manchester Fire Brigade by the Greater Manchester Fire Service hastened the movement of the detachment's home office to another office in Swinton. As a major aspect of the rearrangement, London Road turned into the central station of the unit's "E Division", with the station's control room in charge of two divisions covering the City of Manchester, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport and Tameside. 

The rearrangement implied the quantity of machines was diminished, until just three stayed at the station. The control room at London Road shut down in 1979, supplanted by a solitary electronic control room at detachment base camp in Swinton. 

Around the same time, following the foundation of Greater Manchester Police and a redesign of policing in the city, the police headquarters in the structure likewise shut. The conclusion left the ground floor on the Whitworth Street side unfilled. The last occupants of the bank segment, a firm of specialists, and the fire unit's workshops, likewise abandoned the structure at about a similar time. 

In 1984 development work started on a ÃÅ, substitution in Thompson Street and in 1985 the old London Road Fire Station was brought inside the Whitworth Street Conservation Area. In 1986 the flame administration left London Road for its new flame station, London Road Fire Station shut down and the structure was sold. 

After the deal the structure was basically utilized for capacity while arranging applications to change over it into an inn were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, with fluctuating degrees of accomplishment. The coroner's court was the last to abandon the premises, in 1998. In 2001, the structure was set on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register. By 2004 it was in soak decrease, and energy was working for the fire station's proprietor, Britannia Hotels, to act. 

In February 2006, Argent, engineers proposed renting the structure from Britannia Hotels to change it into a music and expressions scene. Manchester City Council upheld the plans and would not preclude a necessary buy request (CPO) if the proprietor did not act to redevelop the structure. Britannia Hotels marked Argent's arrangements "unworkable" and proposed transforming the structure into an organization central command, 200-bed lodging, and fire station exhibition hall. An arranging application was guaranteed by March 2006, however by May none had been made. Work was completed by February 2007 to make the structure watertight and in harvest time 2007 a proposition was made by Britannia to change over the structure into an inn. 

Britannia Hotels delegated Purcell Miller Tritton to attract up designs to change over the structure into a lodging in 2008 yet none were created by May 2009 and the city gathering lost confidence in Britannia Hotels' promise to its redevelopment. The city chamber was worried that the condition of the flame station was constraining recovery in the zone, including a proposed government complex on the previous Mayfield Railway Station site. The city chamber set a due date of July 2009 for advancement on redevelopment. Britannia Hotels' proposition in July 2009 was to change over the flame station into a lodging with a 15-story tower in its yard and guaranteed an arranging application by October 2009, yet none was made and the city committee's Chief Executive prescribed issuing a CPO. A gathering of the city board in January 2010 endorsed a solicitation for up to ÃÅ5.25Ã¢Â million to take care of the expenses related with the flame station's securing. Britannia Hotels reacted by swearing to make another proposition by February 2010, rendering the CPO pointless. 

Britannia presented an application to transform the flame station into a 227-bed 4-star lodging in June 2010. The Victorian Society lauded the proposed change. Manchester City Council chose to proceed with the CPO. The city chamber issued a CPO on 5 August 2010. Regardless of the plans being affirmed 16 September 2010, the committee kept on pursueing a CPO and requested offers for an advancement accomplice in January 2011. Britannia's complaint to the CPO prompted an open request in April 2011. On 29 November 2011, the Department for Communities and Local Government affirmed the CPO had been rejected. Notwithstanding Britannia's certification at the request to continue with the advancement it rethought its arrangements. In a letter to English Heritage, Britannia said the proposed plan was unsustainable for years to come. Britannia needed to come back to the rejected pinnacle plan. English Heritage and the city board communicated disillusionment. The city committee offered to purchase the structure at market esteem. 

In February 2013 after an open gathering the Friends of London Road Fire Station (FoLRFS) was shaped to pressurize Britannia Hotels and influence the chamber to endeavor a second CPO. The gathering sorted out an online appeal, raising money occasions, open gatherings, an online overview to find local people's perspectives, a craftsmanship display and open commitment with its history, and distributed the result of a Freedom of Information Act demand on what the chamber had done in regards to studying the structure and issuing pressing works takes note. In November 2013, Britannia connected to broaden the 2010 arranging authorizations however in spite of complaints the applications were affirmed on specialized grounds in December 2013. The chamber considered applying for a CPO for the second time in September 2014 and affirmed its expectation to do as such in December 2014 and meet with FoLRFS in mid 2015. FoLRFS got a give from Locality's Community Assets in Difficult Ownership (CADO) program to pay for open effort work. On 30 April 2015, FoLRFS met Pat Bartoli, leader of the gathering's urban recovery group and Howard Bernstein who adulated their crusade. It was declared following the gathering that Britannia Hotels had chosen to sell the structure. 

London Road Fire Station was put available on 1 May 2015 and expected ideas of around ÃÅ10 million while rebuilding is relied upon to cost ÃÅ20Ã¢ÂÂ30 million. Partnered London gained the flame station on 16 November 2015.
