Einherjar 

In Norse folklore, the einherjar (Old Norse truly "the individuals who battle alone") are the individuals who have passed on in fight and are conveyed to Valhalla by valkyries. In Valhalla, the einherjar eat their fill of the daily reviving mammoth SÄÅhrÄÂ­mnir, and valkyries bring them mead (which originates from the udder of the goat HeiÄÂ°rÄÅn). The einherjar get ready every day for the occasions of RagnarÄÅk, when they will progress for a tremendous fight at the field of VÄÂ­grÄÂ­ÄÂ°r. 

The einherjar are validated in the "Lovely Edda", aggregated in the thirteenth century from prior customary sources, the "Composition Edda", written in the thirteenth century by Snorri Sturluson, the lyric "HÄÄkonarmÄÄl" (by the tenth century skald Eyvindr skÄÄldaspillir) as gathered in "Heimskringla", and a stanza of a mysterious tenth century sonnet recognizing the passing of Eric Bloodaxe known as "EirÄÂ­ksmÄÄl" as assembled in "Fagrskinna". 

An etymological association exists between the einherjar and the Harii (a Germanic people groups or figures structure early Germanic old stories bore witness to in the first century AD), and researchers have associated the einherjar to the interminable skirmish of HjaÄÂ°ningavÄÂ­g and the Wild Hunt. The einherjar have been the subject of masterpieces and verse. 

In the sonnet "VafÄÅ¾rÄÅÄÂ°nismÄÄl", Odin draws in the shrewd jÄÅtunn VafÄÅ¾rÄÅÄÂ°nir in a round of minds. Camouflaged as "GagnrÄÄÄÂ°r", Odin asks VafÄÅ¾rÄÅÄÂ°nir "where men battle in courts each day." VafÄÅ¾rÄÅÄÂ°nir reacts that (here "einherjar" is interpreted as "einheriar"): 

In the ballad "GrÄÂ­mnismÄÄl", Odin (camouflaged as "GrÄÂ­mnir") tells the youthful Agnar that the cook AndhrÄÂ­mnir heats up the mammoth SÄÅhrÄÂ­mnir, which he alludes to as "the best of pork", in the compartment EldhrÄÂ­mnir, yet includes that "however few know by what the einheriar are sustained." Further into "GrÄÂ­mnismÄÄl", Odin gives a rundown of valkyries (SkeggjÄÅld, SkÄÅgul, Hildr, ÄÂrÄÅÄÂ°r, HlÄÅkk, HerfjÄÅtur, GÄÅll, GeirahÄÅÄÂ°, RandgrÄÂ­ÄÂ°, RÄÄÄÂ°grÄÂ­ÄÂ°, and Reginleif), and states that they bear brew to the einherjar. Towards the finish of the ballad, another reference to the einherjar shows up when Odin tells the ruler GeirrÄÅd (uninformed that the man he has been tormenting is Odin) that GeirrÄÅd is flushed, and that GeirrÄÅd loses much when he loses his support and the support of "all the Einherjar." 

In the sonnet "HelgakviÄÂ°a Hundingsbana I", the legend SinfjÄÅtli flyts with GuÄÂ°mundr. SinfjÄÅtli blames GuÄÂ°mundr for having once been a female, including that he was "a witch, repulsive, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries" and that the majority of the einherjar "needed to battle, unyielding ladies, for you". 

In the "Writing Edda" book "Gylfaginning", the einherjar are presented in section 20. In part 20, Third tells Gangleri (depicted as ruler Gylfi in mask) that Odin is designated "ValfÄÅÄÂ°r" (Old Norse "father of the killed") "since every one of the individuals who fall in fight are his received children," and that Odin doles out them puts in Valhalla and VingÄÅlf where they are known as einherjar. In part 35, High statements the "GrÄÂ­mnismÄÄl" valkyrie list, and says that these valkyries hold up in Valhalla, and there serve drink, and take care of silverware and savoring vessels Valhalla. Moreover, High says that Odin sends valkyries to each fight, that they designate demise to men, and administer triumph. 

In part 38, High gives more insight regarding the einherjar. Gangleri says that "you state that each one of those men that have fallen fighting since the start of the world have now come to Odin in Val-lobby. What does he have to offer them sustenance? I ought to have felt that there must be a really substantial number there." High answers that it is valid there are an entirely extensive number of men there, adding a lot more presently can't seem to arrive, yet that "there will appear to be too not many when the wolf comes." However, High includes that nourishment isn't an issue in light of the fact that there will never be such a large number of individuals in Valhalla that the meat of SÄÅhrÄÂ­mnir (which he calls a hog) can't adequately bolster. High says that SÄÅhrÄÂ­mnir is cooked each day by the cook AndhrÄÂ­mnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again entire each night. High at that point cites the stanza of "GrÄÂ­mnismÄÄl" referencing the cook, feast, and compartment in reference. 

Further into part 38, Gangleri inquires as to whether Odin expends indistinguishable dinners from the einherjar. High reacts that Odin gives the nourishment on his table to his two wolves Geri and Freki, and that Odin himself needs no sustenance, for Odin picks up sustenance from wine as though it were drink and meat. High at that point cites another stanza from "GrÄÂ­mnismÄÄl" in reference. In section 39, Gangleri asks what the einherjar drink that is as copious as their sustenance, and in the event that they drink water. High reacts that it is abnormal that Gangleri is inquiring as to whether Odin, the All-Father, would welcome lords, barons, and other "men of rank" to his home and give them water to drink. High says that he "swears by his confidence" that numerous who come to Valhalla would believe that he paid a high cost for a beverage of water if there were no better drinks there, in the wake of having kicked the bucket of wounds and in distress. High proceeds with that on Valhalla stands the goat HeiÄÂ°rÄÅn, and it benefits from the foliage of the tree called LÄÅraÄÂ°r. From HeiÄÂ°rÄÅn's udders stream mead that fills a tank multi day. The tank is large to the point that the majority of the einherjar can toast their totality from it. 

In part 40, Gangleri says that Valhalla must be an enormous structure, yet it should frequently be packed around the entryways. High reacts that there are a lot of entryways, and that swarming doesn't happen around them. In help, High again cites a stanza from "GrÄÂ­mnismÄÄl". In part 41, Gangleri takes note of that there are a lot of individuals in Valhalla, and that Odin is an "incredible master when he directions such a troop". Gangleri then asks what amusement the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High reacts that consistently, the einherjar get dressed and "put on war-gear and go out into the yard and battle one another and fall upon one another. This is their game." High says that when supper time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and take a seat to drink. In reference, High statements a stanza from "GrÄÂ­mnismÄÄl". 

In section 51, High predicts the occasions of RagnarÄÅk. After the god Heimdallr stirs every one of the divine beings by blowing his horn Gjallarhorn, they will collect at a thing, Odin will ride to the well MÄÂ­misbrunnr and counsel MÄÂ­mir for the benefit of himself and his kin, the world tree Yggdrasil will shake, and after that the ÄÂsir and the einherjar will wear their war gear. The ÄÂsir and einherjar will ride to the field VÄÂ­grÄÂ­ÄÂ°r while Odin rides before them clad in a brilliant protective cap, mail, and holding his lance Gungnir, and heading towards the wolf Fenrir. 

In section 52, Gangleri asks what will occur after the sky, earth, and the majority of the world are singed and the divine beings, einherjar and all of humankind have kicked the bucket, taking note of that he had recently been informed that "everybody will live in some world or other for ever and ever." High answers with a rundown of areas, and afterward portrays the re-developing of the world after RagnarÄÅk. The einherjar get a last notice in the "Writing Edda" in part 2 of the book "SkÄÄldskaparmÄÄl", where a statement from the mysterious tenth century ballad "EirÄÂ­ksmÄÄl" is given (see the " Fagrskinna" area beneath for more detail and another interpretation from another source): 

Toward the finish of the "Heimskringla" adventure "HÄÄkonar adventure gÄÅÄÂ°a", the ballad "HÄÄkonarmÄÄl" (by the tenth century skald Eyvindr skÄÄldaspillir) is exhibited. The adventure relates that lord Haakon I of Norway passed on in fight, but then however he is Christian, he demands that since he has kicked the bucket "among rapscallions, at that point give me such internment place as appears to be most fitting to you." The adventure relates that, soon after, Haakon passed on a similar piece of shake that he was conceived upon, that he was significantly grieved by companion and adversary alike, and that his companions moved his body northward to SÄÅheim in North Hordaland. Haakon was there covered in a substantial entombment hill in full defensive layer and his best dressing, yet with no different resources. Further, "words were spoken over his grave as indicated by the custom of barbarian men, and they put him while in transit to Valhalla." The ballad "HÄÄkonarmÄÄl" is then given. 

In "HÄÄkonarmÄÄl", Odin sends forward the two valkyries GÄÅndul and SkÄÅgul to "pick among the lords' family" and who in fight ought to stay with Odin in Valhalla. A fight seethes with extraordinary butcher. Haakon and his men bite the dust in fight, and they see the valkyrie GÄÅndul inclining toward a lance shaft. GÄÅndul remarks that "groweth now the divine beings' following, since HÄÄkon has been with host so goodly bidden home with heavenly godheads." Haakon hears "what the valkyries said," and the valkyries are depicted as sitting "high-hearted on horseback," wearing head protectors, conveying shields and that the ponies admirably bore them. A short trade pursues among Haakon and the valkyrie SkÄÅgul: 

SkÄÅgul says that they will currently ride forward to the "green homes of the godheads" to reveal to Odin the ruler will come to Valhalla. In Valhalla, Haakon is welcomed by HermÄÅÄÂ°r and Bragi. Haakon communicates worry that he will get Odin's abhor (Lee Hollander speculates this might be because of Haakon's transformation to Christianity from his local heathenism), yet Bragi reacts that he is welcome: 

In part 8 of "Fagrskinna", a composition story expresses that, after the demise of her better half Eric Bloodaxe, Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a lyric formed about him. The structure is by a mysterious creator from the tenth century and is alluded to as "EirÄÂ­ksmÄÄl", and portrays Eric Bloodaxe and five different rulers landing in Valhalla after their passing. The ballad starts with remarks by Odin (as Old Norse "ÄÂÄÂ°inn"): 

The god Bragi asks where a roaring solid is originating from, and says that the seats of Valhalla are creakingÃ¢ÂÂas if the god Baldr had come back to ValhallaÃ¢ÂÂand that it sounds like the development of a thousand. Odin reacts that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will before long land in Valhalla. Odin advises the legends Sigmund and SinfjÄÅtli to ascend to welcome Eric and welcome him into the lobby, in the event that it is without a doubt he. 

Sigmund asks Odin for what valid reason he would expect Eric more than some other lord, to which Odin reacts that Eric has blushed his butchery splashed sword with numerous different grounds. Eric arrives, and Sigmund welcomes him, discloses to him that he is free to come into the lobby, and asks him what different masters he has conveyed with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five rulers, that he will reveal to them the name of all, and that he, himself, is the 6th. 

As per John Lindow, Andy Orchard, and Rudolf Simek, researchers have usually associated the einherjar to the Harii, a Germanic clan validated by Tacitus in his first century AD work "Germania". 

Tacitus composes: 

Lindow says that "numerous researchers think there might be reason for the legend in an antiquated Odin faction, which would be focused on youthful warriors who went into a delighted association with Odin" and that the name "Harii" has been etymologically associated with the "- herjar" component of "einherjar". Simek says that since the association has turned out to be across the board, "one will in general translate these clearly living multitudes of the dead as religiously propelled groups of warriors, who prompted the arrangement of the idea of the "einherjar" just as the Wild Hunt [...]". Simek proceeds with that the idea of an interminable fight and day by day restoration shows up in book I of Saxo Grammaticus' "Gesta Danorum" and in reports of the endless clash of HjaÄÂ°ningavÄÂ­g. 

As per GuÄÂ°brandur VigfÄÅsson, the idea of the einherjar interfaces straightforwardly to the Old Norse name "Einarr". VigfÄÅsson remarks that "the name Einarr is appropriately = einheri", and focuses to a connection to the term with the Old Norse regular things "einarÄÂ°r" (signifying "intense") and "einÄÅrÄÂ°" (signifying "valor").
