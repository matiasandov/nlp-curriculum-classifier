In March 1998, AndrÄÅ¡ 3000 and Big Boi obtained a studio off Northside Drive in Atlanta which had some time ago had a place with R&B vocalist Bobby Brown.

The two named the studio "Stankonia", a word made by AndrÄÅ¡ 3000 as a blend of the words "stank", a slang equivalent word for "out of control", and "Plutonia", the title of a notice in his room portraying a modern city.

The chronicle of "Stankonia" started in spring of 1999 and went on for about a year. Owning a studio helped the band grow inventively, as the team did not have to stress over time imperatives that would happen with a leased studio. AndrÄÅ¡ 3000 watched, "You can stay there and fuck with only a kick and a catch throughout the day in the event that you need toÃ¢Â ... You're not taking a shot at the clock. Truly, you're simply taking a shot at your psyche." Big Boi spent most of the chronicle time in the studio, while AndrÄÅ¡ 3000 worked at home, making beats and trying different things with an acoustic guitar. One melody that originated from a jam session on the guitar was "Ms. Jackson", the collection's second single.

One stray verse on his divider in the long run formed into "Fuel Dreams". 

A great part of the collection was detailed amid "vibe sessions" in which the gathering and makers would visit clubs in downtown Atlanta, select entertainers they saw, and welcome them to the studio. They would then "lounge around, smoke a couple, drink a couple", and make thoughts for new melodies. Be that as it may, recording sessions wound up troublesome as AndrÄÅ¡ 3000 became worn out on rapping on melodies, which made Big Boi and the makers uneasy about how the music would sound. To keep up melodic union with Big Boi while proceeding to grow his vocal palette, AndrÄÅ¡ chose to consolidate rapping with soul-motivated warbling, which impacted "Stankonia's" sound. "Snappin and Trappin'" highlights a visitor appearance from that point obscure rapper Killer Mike. The rapper noticed that while working with OutKast, he utilized the chance to attempt to "contend" with the team to improve his rapping aptitudes. Huge Boi was inspired with Killer Mike's capacities, noticing, "When I initially heard him spit, his voice was simply so instructing. He's an exceptionally canny person." 

While OutKast's past collections were viewed as laid-back, smooth endeavors, "Stankonia" contains quicker, progressively high-vitality rhythms, incompletely to mirror the "confused occasions" at the turn of the 21st century. The gathering observed new, harder medications hitting the hip bounce scene and youngsters utilizing joy, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Huge Boi reflected, "Niggas carrying on with this life at a quick speed don't have the foggiest idea about what's happening around them. On the off chance that you live quick, you going to leave here genuine quick, so the music need to demonstrate that." While recording "Stankonia", the band abstained from tuning in to hip jump, "That music was beginning to sound genuine agreeable. There wasn't any experience to it." Instead, the couple drew impact from performers, for example, Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Prince. In any case, the band avoided creating a return sound with the record and rather would have liked to use these impacts in an advanced, test design. 

On "Stankonia", OutKast explored different avenues regarding a wide assortment of melodic kinds. As indicated by M. Matos of "Vibe", "Stankonia" "transformed the South's prevalently leaned back hip-bounce sound into something freaky and threatening."

The smooth tunes of "I'll Call Before I Come" have additionally been compared to Prince. "Gas Dreams" has been named a "dirty shake scorcher" equivalent to crafted by Public Enemy. David Bry of "Vibe" recognized a "cleaned 80's pimp swagger" in "So Fresh, So Clean" and a "grateful, fat-ass ricochet" in "We Luv Deez Hoes". The collection closes with three hallucinogenic affected tracks, "Can Tisha", "Ghetto Beautiful", and "Stankonia (Stank Love)".

The collection usually includes the words "stank" and "smell" in their blues definition to signify "down and out, obtuse, sharp: a proportion of legitimacy". The gathering frequently joins word play into the verses, including references to the "underground smellroad" and serenades of "I stank I can, I stank I can", an implication to "The Little Engine That Could". The melody "Red Velvet" talks about the materialistic idea of the hip jump scene. "Humble Mumble" addresses commentators who make negative suppositions about hip jump dependent on assumptions; AndrÄÅ¡ 3000 raps in the melody: "I met a faultfinder/I made her poop her draws/She said she thought hip bounce was just firearms and liquor/I said gracious hellfire naw/however yet it's that as well/You can't discrima-despise cause you done peruse a book or two." 

A significant part of the collection examines the status of ladies in the South, and stands out from the misanthropic dispositions regular in hip jump music.

In "Can Tisha", the couple understands self-destructive pregnant adolescents. "Ms. Jackson" is committed to the mother of a mother of a with only one parent present kid, which AndrÄÅ¡ 3000 alludes to as "the child's mom's moms". The tune was propelled by his association with artist Erykah Badu, the mother of his kid, Seven, and fills in as a conciliatory sentiment to her mom for causing her little girl torment.
